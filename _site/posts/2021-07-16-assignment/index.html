<h1 id="task">1. Task</h1>
<p>The task is to use visual analytics to examine text data comprising:</p>
<ul>
<li>news articles;</li>
<li>GAStech employee email headers;</li>
<li>GAStech employee records; and</li>
<li>GAStech employee resumes</li>
</ul>
<p>in order to answer the following questions.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong> Characterize the news data sources provided. Which are primary sources and which are derivative sources? What are the relationships between the primary and derivative sources? Please limit your answer to 8 images and 300 words.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION 2:</strong> Characterize any biases you identify in these news sources, with respect to their representation of specific people, places, and events. Give examples. Please limit your answer to 6 images and 500 words.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION 3:</strong> Given the data sources provided, use visual analytics to identify potential official and unofficial relationships among GASTech, POK, the APA, and Government. Include both personal relationships and shared goals and objectives. Provide evidence for these relationships. Please limit your answer to 6 images and 400 words.</p>
<h1 id="data-preparation">2. Data Preparation</h1>
<p>Firstly, we will need to clean up and process the data into data tables to facilitate analysis. We will use a combination of R tools and manual inspection/editing to clean up the data.</p>
<p>There are three main datasets that will need to be processed and tidied up. The first set comprises the news articles. They will have to be collected into a data table for analysis, with key article details such as title, author, publish date, etc. extracted to facilitate analysis. The second set of data comprises the employee relationships to each other, as well as entities such as countries, organisations, persons outside GAStech, etc. The third and final set of data comprises email headers for two weeks worth of emails, along with labels of the type of emails.</p>
<h2 id="news-articles">2.1. News Articles</h2>
<p>There is noise in the news article data, which includes incosistent line breaks, inconsistent formatting of article details such as dates, author names, etc., and inconsistent details provided per article. This has to be taken into account in processing the article data.</p>
<h3 id="step-2.1.1-combine-articles-into-single-table-for-checking"><strong>Step 2.1.1:</strong> Combine articles into single table for checking</h3>
<p>We first begin by combining the article data into a single table to facilitate checks. We get the easy part out of the way and clean up the line breaks, by replacing all double line breaks with single line breaks with the code below.</p>

<p>Using the prepared data, we now answer the questions with the help of some meaningful visualisations.</p>
<h2 id="question-1">3.1. Question 1</h2>
<p><em>Characterize the news data sources provided. Which are primary sources and which are derivative sources? What are the relationships between the primary and derivative sources? Please limit your answer to 8 images and 300 words.</em></p>
<h3 id="solution-approach-and-data-wrangling">3.1.1. Solution Approach and Data Wrangling</h3>
<p>There are two ways to detect derivative sources:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>presence of other news source name in the text (e.g. quoting or crediting another news source)</li>
<li>same title and author as another article (e.g. reprinting or republishing a previous article from another news source)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>STEP 1:</strong> Identify presence of other news source name</p>
<p>For the first approach, we will establish a listing of all news sources, and then check each article text for the presence of other news sources. We will use the detects to generate an adjacency matrix to visualise the links between articles. The relationship will be defined as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The primary source will be the news source quoted</li>
<li>The derivative source is the article doing the quoting</li>
<li>The relationship is defined as “Quoting”</li>

<p>There are only six quoting relationships detected in Step 1. We will see if we can derive more insight from the data in Step 2.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 2:</strong> Identify articles with same title and author</p>
<p>First we compile a list of unique title-author combinations and extract the earliest publication of each combination. This list will be the basis for comparison against all the articles. Any articles published after the earliest publication is necessarily a reprint of the primary source.</p>

<p>One quick observation that we can make is that there are several instances where articles share titles (i.e. exact match) with one combination with an author’s name indicated but another combination without an author’s name. This indicates that there might be situations either where one source is plagarising another or authors with one publication are re-using their work with another publication without using their bylines.</p>
<p>To further investigate this we shall extract the text of all articles which share the same title for comparison. We should note that if there is only one news source that has used this title (even if there are multiple articles), then this article could be a topic header for a developing story, with periodic updates being provided. In such a case, we ignore it as it does not show a primary-derivative source relationship.</p>

To direct the detachment of forces is inspector greater Loblaw Robert, official of the veteran who lead very to guessed right equipment of Tethys Counterdrug.  He is optimist who he can identify the source.\n\"These drugs of designer have certain tracks as far as their origin,\" Loblaw these times in an interview.  \"Whenever the prescription changes, it leaves tracks as far as it did whom it.  It is like a pedigrí.\"\nThis particular mixture of drug MDMC, also known by its street names the \"caramel of cotton\", the \"spice soña\" and the \"flower of tulip\", was found previously only in Asteria but it has made his way to the streets of Tethys and other international countries.\n\"I will hardly watch the activities of the army of people of Asterian,\" Loblaw this.  \"Our previous investigations indicated to them like the source of this particular formulation.\"\nThe army of people of Asterian (APA) is an organization paramilitary that has been contracted the financed activities of the terrorist with its criminal companies, that include drug traffic.  These last years the APA has tried to construct to their trade name with Web site and the publication of a professional compartment, of high called quality \"Arise\".\nInspector greater Loblaw says the public statistic of Tethys indicates that MDMC is a problem every greater time with the youth of the country.  \"An increase in mental problems of health, including the hallucinations and the paranoia, accompanied by violent behavior and an increase marked in tariffs of the suicide are only some of the indicators of the use of this drug of designer.\"\n\"In the first place we have alerted to harbor civil employees to be in the observation post for the suspicious shipments of insecticides and detergent, both similars in aspect to MDMC.\"\n \n","DOC_ID:  714.txt \n SOURCE:  All News Today \n AUTHOR:   \n PUBLISHED:  19-01-2014 \n LOCATION:  ABILA, Kronos \n \n \nFollowing the annual GAStech-Kronos corporate meeting GAStech executives and several high-ranking Kronos government officials will attend a celebration at the Kronos capital building to celebrate the unfettered kleptocracy that has kept Kronos public officials in mansions and luxury vehicles.\n \n","DOC_ID:  77.txt \n SOURCE:  All News Today \n AUTHOR:   \n PUBLISHED:  21-06-2011 \n LOCATION:  ABILA, Kronos \n \n \nTwo years ago yesterday Elian Karel died at age 28 in an Abila jail cell, purportedly of cardiac arrest.  Kraft had reached an agreement with the government that charges would be reduced and the Karel be released pending a trial, but Karel died two days before he was to go free. \nQuestions linger, however, about the manner of Karel's death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police,  whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death, would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation.  After Karel's body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel's death stating that \"we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries.\"\nAs reported at the time of Karel's death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel's body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police. \nPolice have denied anything unusual happened in Karel's death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence. \nYesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water.   \n\"Both of them died because of government lies and corruption,\" one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.  \"Juliana died because Kronos allowed GAStech to poison our water, and Elian died because he tried to bring Juliana justice.\"\n \n","DOC_ID:  633.txt \n SOURCE:  News Online Today \n AUTHOR:   \n PUBLISHED:  20-01-2014 \n LOCATION:  ABILA, Kronos \n \n \nAbila Airport fueler Ravi Danisliau confirmed that two private jets took off today after being fueled.  \nThe second plane also carried seven or eight \"business types\", but seemed \"much more relaxed than the first group of passengers\". The second plane departed around 14:30 around two hours after the first plane.\n \n","DOC_ID:  651.txt \n SOURCE:  International Times \n AUTHOR:   \n PUBLISHED:  07-02-2013 \n LOCATION:   \n \n \nThe Emergency Department at Abila General Hospital in Kronos has been swamped in the last month by people suffering medical complications from designer drugs such as \"cotton candy\" and synthetic marijuana, a hospital official said.\n\"We have had at least two dozen cases in the last month,\" said Alicia Bianca, nurse manager of the department. \"We are literally overwhelmed.\"\nBianca said she has never seen this level of activity related to drug overdoses in the seven years she has managed the Emergency Department and in the 20 years she has been a nurse.\nAuthorities in Abila said \"cotton candy\" may have been a factor in the death of 54-year-old Ralf Potter, whose bruised and naked body was found February 4 along a dead-end road. Investigators are awaiting toxicology reports to determine the cause of his death. Citywide, several deaths have been attributed to \"Cotton Candy\" according to the Kronos National Poison Center.\nPatients are coming to Abila General from throughout the greater city region, and they include adults and youths, male and female, and all socio-economic backgrounds, Bianca said.\nSgt Antonio Arresta of the Abila Fire Department, a first-responder to emergency medical calls in the city, said his department has also seen a spike in the number of people needing treatment for complications from designer drugs. \"We went from zero calls to a handful of calls\" in the last month,\" he said.\nBianca and Arresta said their efforts to treat people is made more difficult because they often do not know anything about the designer drugs that were taken.\n\"You don't know what you're getting when you get it,\" Bianca said. \"We have had patients come in and act out of control, who are very violent. They tell us they have been doing cotton candy or synthetic marijuana.\"\nBianca said there is little clinical data on the effects of cotton candy, as it is an emerging toxicant. \"There are no controlled studies in toxicology,\" she said. The national poison center collects anecdotal reports on overdoses from hospitals and other providers as part of efforts to offer advice on how to treat patients.\nDesigner drugs are chemical compounds synthesized to resemble the active ingredient in often illegal drugs. Cotton candy mimics the drug khat, a stimulant. Manufacturers frequently change the designer drug's chemical composition and its name to stay one step ahead of authorities, Biance said. \"It is another way to sell it,\" she said.\nThe term cotton candy, for example, is a nickname of the drug and has nothing to do with the carnival treat. The drug has been sold under the name of \"Spice Dreams\" one week and under the name of \"Tulip Blossom\" the next. \nThe Kronos government has placed three of the chemicals commonly used in the creation of cotton candy on its controlled substance list, criminalizing their use and possession. Still, the government cannot outright ban cotton candy because manufacturers can alter the recipe and skirt the law, Bianca said. The drugs are sold online as \"herbal therapy\" products and are available over the counter in area stores.\n\"We still don't know what you are getting with cotton candy. The chemical composition varies from package to package,\" Bianca said.\nOne factor for the popularity of cotton candy is its low cost, Bianca said. She said a gram of cotton candy costs about K18 while a gram of cocaine costs K166.\nCotton candy creates euphoria, or a high, that is equal to or greater than that of cocaine but also causes a crash that is worse, Bianca said. The crash's ill-effects often prompt people to binge on cotton candy to the point where they consume the drug for days. \"They crave it,\" she said.\nAfter repeated use, the drug \"fries\" a person's brain, draining the chemicals that balance its operations. This sometimes leads to bizarre, often psychotic behavior that has been reported in the media, such as the case of the naked man in Elodis who was found running down the middle of a major highway, Bianca said. \"The seizures and delusions are incredible,\" she said.\nWhile it is not yet certain who is behind the distribution of this round of designer drugs, police suspect organized crime is pursuing this large income source. The Asterian People's Army has traditionally been involved with drug trafficking throughout the region, and enforcement agencies are closely examining possible cooperation between drug trafficking organizations and political insurgent groups.\n \n","DOC_ID:  282.txt \n SOURCE:  International Times \n AUTHOR:   \n PUBLISHED:  20-06-2012 \n LOCATION:   \n \n \nTraffic snarled around the city as Abilians struggle to get to work amid vandalism and looting\nEarly on Tuesday police stormed the front of the presidential mansion and the capital building, breaking up a sit in by the Protectors of Kronos.\nOther activist groups have joined the protesting faction in solidarity and a bigger rally was predicted for later in the day.\nThe conservative Kronos government used an emergency law to threaten the protestors with arrest unless they dispersed and returned to work.  The row is over environmental issues the POK holds the government and the gas giant GAStech international responsible.\nThe rallies had begun peacefully, however more destructive activities have escalated as the crowds became more restless. \nSigns among the protester called for government change and social equality.  Images of Juliana Vann, the 10 year old girl who died from illnesses attributed to the industrial giant GAStech international served as rallying points.\nPeople heading to a pro-government counter-rally were attacked by POK supporters, and later shots were fired.  \nTuesday was the third anniversary of the mysterious death of Elian Karel, a popular leader of the POK who died in prison. \nLater in the day, what had been a largely peaceful demonstration turned violent when the crowd started vandalizing government buildings and the presidential homestead.  \nA group of younger protestors attacked vehicles, smashing windows.  Minor injuries were reported. \nPolice reinforcements were sent to the area and blocked roads, and skirmishes between the police and protestors broke out. \nPolice used tear gas to break up the unruly crowd.

Karel's lawyer, Michale Kraft, released a statement declaring that the charges against his client were false and that he hoped to have Karel released from police custody by week's end.  It is clear that Elian Karel, who professes to have the interests of the people of Kronos at heart, must explain to us why he refuses to contribute to the welfare of his nation.\n \n","DOC_ID:  129.txt \n SOURCE:  International News \n AUTHOR:   \n PUBLISHED:  31-08-2001 \n LOCATION:  ABILA, Kronos \n \n \nFive young people were arrested yesterday for protesting near the entrance to the Tiskele Bend fields as they called for government action to address their environmental concerns about GAStech's operations at the site.  The protestors, members of the activist group \"Protectors of Kronos\", held signs reading: \"Drilling Poisoned Our Water\" and \"Remember Juliana\", referring to 10 year old Juliana Vann, who has become an icon for the Protectors of Kronos since her death in 1998.  The protestors were arrested after one young man threw his sign at a government vehicle, cracking its window and startling the occupants.  Police spokesman Adrien Carman said of the arrests, \"We decided to shut the protest down before the POK members escalated to further violence.  \"The people of Kronos have overwhelmingly been for the development of our natural resources and all have benefited from the resultant economic growth.\n \n","DOC_ID:  636.txt \n SOURCE:  International News \n AUTHOR:   \n PUBLISHED:  18-03-2001 \n LOCATION:  ABILA, Kronos \n \n \nA motion to increase taxes on oil and gas development by an additional 10% was defeated today in the General Assembly by a vote of 77 to 23.  The proposed tax increase, championed by Minister of Health Cesare Nespola, was to provide specific funding for health care, clean water projects, and health education for rural areas.  Minister Nespola said of the Assembly vote, \"I'm disappointed by the vote, but the Assembly was concerned that the increase in tax would discourage foreign investment in our energy sector.  Additionally, I will work with President Kapelou's office to restructure the allocation of funds from current gas and oil taxes to provide for rural health projects.\"\n \n","DOC_ID:  34.txt \n SOURCE:  Central Bulletin \n AUTHOR:   \n PUBLISHED:  14-06-2010 \n LOCATION:  ABILA, Kronos \n \n \nLast year spontaneous protests and riots broke out around Abila in response to the death of Elian Karel, a Protectors of Kronos (POK) activist. Officials fear a repeat of last year's violent activities around the city on the upcoming anniversary of Karel's death on June 19.  \nGovernment officials issued a brief statement assuring the people of Abila that their \"safety is of the utmost importance. Groups like the Protectors of Kronos operate by fear, attempting to change lives and government through fear. \nThe brief government statement ended there with a promise not to back down to protesters, if there are indeed protests.

However, after several hours of chanting and speeches, tempers in the crowd flared and protestors rushed the police line.  The police forces were forced to use tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons, and rubber bullets to subdue the crowd and protect property.  In spite of their heroic efforts, the protestors managed to break some windows, damage several police vehicles, and injure three officers.\n \n","DOC_ID:  547.txt \n SOURCE:  International News \n AUTHOR:   \n PUBLISHED:  21-11-1995 \n LOCATION:  ABILA, Kronos \n \n \nPresident Araullo announced today that his government is planning the construction of a new, modern Abila General Hospital.  The old Abila General Hospital, built in 1930, has outdated health care facilities and has suffered numerous electrical fires in the past decade.  Hospital Administrator Torsten Trucco lauded the government's action saying, \"We've been trying to get funding to update our facilities for years, to no avail.

In Tethys a few years ago, I journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of Tethys to look at a contentious new energy producing area.\nOne of the sites I visited was a local office of the Sanjorge Gas company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation. As I remember it, a former trucker was in charge.\nIt was a vivid example of how a once small exploration company from Thethys had begun to grow into a mighty international force in the energy industry.\nBut I'd forgotten about the encounter until I went back to Tethys the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: one man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it.\nBut as I went round the capital city of Centrum interviewing people, I soon realised that this was not just a story of new energy. Something very significant has happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas industry expertise. From what's developed in the capital city there are important lessons for other places blessed (and cursed) with abundant natural resources.\n\"Centrum developed world class expertise in engineering in very difficult surroundings\"\nWhen I was a young newspaperman on the Daily Record in Glasgow in the early 1970s, the great off-shore oil rush was beginning in the North Sea. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, turning an island of coal into a place with abundant oil and gas supplies.\nIt seemed to us on the west coast of Scotland that the far flung city of Centrum, Tethys was getting a bit big for its boots, starting to believe in a new fantasy industry.\nMuch to his mother's regrets, meanwhile, Sten Sanjorge had started prospecting in the early 1960s.\nBy the early 1970s, a new gas company, GAStech, began its juggernaut-like advances.\nUnder his canny guidance, GAStech evolved into a major supplier of natural gas to the local region, and then much further afield. It now has thousands employees and operates in numerous countries. \nThe change in Centrum has been substantial.  You notice them in the constant clutter of helicopters to-ing and fro-ing out to remote areas, and the planes lined up at the city's airport to shuttle execs back and forth from the city.\nAnd as you drive round Centrum, almost every roundabout is sponsored by a division of GAStech. \nSanjorge has recently started paying more attention to leisure activities and philanthropy, allowing his son Sten Jr. and co-founder Hank Fluss to run the company. But Sanjorge has just been asked to produce a report for the Tethan government recommending the best ways of ensuring that Tethys continues to produce energy for decades to come.\nThe easy-to-get stuff has been produced, so keeping the gas coming will need much investment and more clever new techniques, such as the hyper-acidic substrate removal techniques developed by the company in 1974. \nSo thanks to clever people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, Centrum has achieved what every place where raw materials are discovered longs to do. The city has taken the temporary boon of energy on its doorstep, and turned it into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which may make Centrum a centre of gas expertise long after the gas itself runs out.\n \n","DOC_ID:  314.txt \n SOURCE:  News Online Today \n AUTHOR:   \n PUBLISHED:  30-03-1995 \n LOCATION:  CENTRUM, Tethys \n \n \nGAStech International's Hyper Acidic Substrate Removal (HASR) has officially been banned by the Tethys government due to the high probability of water contamination.\n \n","DOC_ID:  389.txt \n SOURCE:  News Online Today \n AUTHOR:   \n PUBLISHED:  15-05-2011 \n LOCATION:  ABILA, Kronos \n \n \nAn alarming new trend is sweeping Abila.  \nThe concerns over the increase of drug related arrests are two-fold: first, violent activist groups such as the Protectors of Kronos could be using drug sales as a means to fund their activities;\n \n","DOC_ID:  554.txt \n SOURCE:  All News Today \n AUTHOR:   \n PUBLISHED:  20-06-2009 \n LOCATION:  ABILA, Kronos \n \n \nElian Karel, age 28, died Friday while unlawfully incarcerated at the Abila City Prison.

This article is the first installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos. \nELODIS, Kronos - Nestled in the bend of the Tiskele River, the sun rises over the farming town of Elodis,  chasing away the shadows cloaking nearby Mt.  Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos. \nTwo weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around Tiskele Bend.  \"The gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away. \nThe change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out of Tethys. \nEstablished in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis. \nWith a population of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a cafe. Here you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations. \n\"We've made a good living for a long time,\" Reese tells me. \nI asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech's operations.   \nI caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at the Osvaldo hardware store to repair a broken tractor.

Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm.\n\"We've worked the land for a long time - maybe 200 years, maybe a bit more,\" Henk Bodrogi told me as he picked over a container of bolts, searching for the right size.  \"Over the years we've added a few hectares here and there.  It keeps us busy.\"\nBusy is an understatement, as I found when I prodded the wiry farmer to tell me more.\n\"I usually head to the fields before sun up,\" Mr. Henk Bodrogi tells me. \"My wife gets the kids up and heading to school, then she'll make a little something for us to eat for lunch and work alongside me until dinner.  When the children get home from school they do their chores, and we're all back at the house most times by dark.\"\n\"We do this most days,\" he adds, \"except for worship days.\"\nBodrogi identifies the appropriate bolt and chats with the cashier about kids and school as he completes his purchase.\n\"We all know one another here,\" Bodrogi explains as we leave. \"Most families have lived here for generations.  The first new people that came to town were with that gas company that built a few years back.\"\nI ask Bodrogi if business has been good. \n\"We were doing pretty good until recently.  Profits were good and we add acreage, or upgrade equipment.  Then we started having all this trouble with the crops.\"\nIn what way, I asked.\n\"The crops aren't producing like they have in the past.  It took a while to figure out, then one of the city officers figured out to call in a water specialist.  When they tested it they said the water was contaminated.\"\nBodrodgi sighed, and with a beleaguered look in his eye he thanked me for my interest and told me he had to head back home.  The tractor had to be fixed before they could work the next day.  I thanked him and watched him climb into his truck and head out of town.\nThe water specialist turned out to be the international agency \"Wellness For All\", an international agency with a mission to bring healthy water to communities distressed by natural disasters, draught and - coincidentally - oil and gas development.\nI caught up with a representative from Wellness for All the next day.  Joclyn Reynolds is project coordinator for \"Wellness for All\".  She spoke to me over a satellite call from her field office in Southeast Asia where she was setting up relief efforts following an earthquake. Ms. Reynolds agreed to speak to me for a few minutes between meetings about their work in Elodis.\n\"We were contacted by a city official about a problem they were having with their local water.  In the last few years agriculture had foundered, and the incidence of certain illnesses and birth defects had risen.  The Elodis drinking water comes from the Tiskele River, as does all the water for farming, so we looked for a source upstream.  We found sources of production waste disposal at the GAStech operation upstream.  Tests showed high levels of benzene, toluene, xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, among other toxins. \"\n\"Can these substances occur naturally?\" I asked her.\n\"Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly.  Groundwater contamination is usually the result of human activity.  The GAStech pipes are releasing contaminants into a pond.  The toxins are forming a subsurface plume that seeps into the Tiskele River from which the residents of Elodis draw their drinking water and irrigation for the crops.\"\n\"Did you talk to GAStech about this?\"\n\"Oh yes,\" she replied.  \"At first we believed we were gaining traction.  We met several times with GAStech representatives, including one of the senior executives, Hank Fluss.  He personally assured us GAStech would act responsibly to provide material and financial assistance toward cleanup efforts.  After a time, though, it became clear that while Mr. Fluss was earnest it was Sanjorge who makes the decisions.  It is apparent that he [Sanjorge] has no interest in the wellbeing of the residents of Elodis, or the environment.\"\nSten Sanjorge, Jr., who had inherited his share in the company from his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for cutthroat business practices.\n\"When we didn't make headway with GAStech,\" Reynolds continued, \"the community leaders decided to approach the government of Kronos for assistance.   Per our policy -and with permission from the Elodis leaders - we published the test results in an official public document.  The Elodis leaders then approached the government officials as citizens of a Kronesian community armed with the scientific analysis.  Our agency assured them we would again be available to help in any way when those agreements were finalized.\"\nAt this point Ms Reynolds was called away from the phone, so I returned to my editor friend, Pondo Reese to tell finish the story.\nPart Three will be published May 15, 1998 \n","DOC_ID:  237.txt \n SOURCE:  All News Today \n AUTHOR:   \n PUBLISHED:  15-05-1998 \n LOCATION:   \n \n \nNOTE: This article is the last installment of a three\nThis article is the last installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos.

But projects in Europe have been slow to take off, beset with opposition from government and local communities.\nSanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited.\nMany environmentalists believe that hyper-acidic substrate removal can damage marine environments, and oppose the extraction of new fossil fuel resources. But drilling offshore avoids the need for difficult negotiations with local councils, communities and landholders.\nBased on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech's estimates for its onshore resources. There is also the possibility of finding oil.\nGAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore.\n\"We're very comfortable that the resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous,\" SanJorge said. \"Is any of that exploitable? That's the billion dollar question, and GAStech is wiling to invest in the answer.\"\nThough it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done.\nProfessor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term.\n\"GAStech is being optimistic is its estimates of how long it will take to explore offshore shale. It's perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyper-acidic substrate removal technology will have so advanced and the way in which we deal with the offshore environment will have so advanced that this could be a really big industry.

The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts that GAStech International's Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis. However, with the fragmenting of WFA due to funding issues, the POK's demands were largely ignored and downplayed. The Government of Kronos officially refuted the claim citing the fragmentation of the WFA organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted. Regardless, Juliana became the POK's first martyr and has used Juliana's image on campaign literature ever since.  \nThe POK's second major martyr is Elian Karel, who died in 2009 while incarcerated of undetermined causes. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion. Karel had been involved with the POK since its inception given that his father, Jeroen Karel, was an original member.  \nThe POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people.

He had been arrested three months prior for spurious charges of tax evasion and left to linger in a jail cell without further legal action.  His attorney, Michale Kraft made several appearances in court demanding that the government outline their specific charges, and release Karel.  Kraft had reached an agreement with the government that charges would be reduced and the Karel be released pending a trial, but Karel died two days before he was to go free.\nQuestions linger, however, about the manner of Karel’s death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police –whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death – would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation.\nThis “thorough investigation” lasted all of two weeks, including the time it took the Abila City Coroner to lose the original autopsy files.  After Karel’s body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel’s death stating that “we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries.”\nAs reported at the time of Karel’s death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel’s body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police.

Bouro.  Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos.\nTwo weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around Tiskele Bend. In his email he described a once bountiful region now distressed by contamination, struggling to find solutions to a worsening problem.  I decided to investigate.\n\"We didn't make the connection at first,\" Reese told me when I met with him at his office.  \"The gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away.   After a couple of harvests, we saw a decline in the production.   We thought perhaps it was just a hiccup, and things would get better.  Then when the kids started getting sick we took a harder look at what could have changed.\"\nThe change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out of Tethys.\nEstablished in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis.\nWith a population of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a café where you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations.\n\"We've made a good living for a long time,\" Reese tells me. \"The population has been steadily increasing.  Crop production has been good.  For the most part, kids haven't left for the city as they have in a lot of other rural places.  We have a lot of land that could yet be developed. There was a future for them here.\"\nI asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech's operations.

He believes there are large volumes of offshore gas that could be extracted. \n\"Certainly offshore gas isn't a new concept, but there's no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can't develop these resources offshore,\" he told the Times. \nShale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within. \nHyper-acidic substrate removal has produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the West, transforming the energy market. \nSanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited. \nBased on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech's estimates for its onshore resources. \nGAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore. \nThough it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done. \nProfessor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term. \n\"GAStech is being optimistic is its estimates of how long it will take to explore offshore shale. It's perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyper-acidic substrate removal technology will have so advanced and the way in which we deal with the offshore environment will have so advanced that this could be a really big industry.\n \n","DOC_ID:  185.txt \n SOURCE:  The Abila Post \n AUTHOR:   \n PUBLISHED:  20-06-2009 \n LOCATION:  ABILA, Kronos \n \n \nProtests erupted around the Kronos government buildings, downtown, and elsewhere around Abila eventually escalating into riots and violence. \nThe activists are protesting the death yesterday of Elian Karel, a Protector of Kronos (POK) activist who died in jail after being arrested for tax evasion.

The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts that GAStech International's Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis. \nIn 1998, WFA performed testing on the water of Elodis finding high levels of benzene, toluene and xylene arsenic, barium, chromium, lead and selenium.

<p>Briefly, from comparing some of the text in the above table, it appears that Petrus Gerhard is recycling articles that he writes for <em>Homeland Illumination</em> for <em>All News Today</em> (simply shortening the article and changing one or two words for <em>All News Today</em>), and often on the same day. Marcella Trapani and Eva Thayer are doing similar at <em>International News</em> while officially writing for <em>Kronos Star</em>. There are many other cases, indicating that this “Shadow Author” phenomenon is probably much more widespread than previously expected. This warrants deeper investigation!!</p>
<p>To detect “Shadow Author” relationships, we will borrow a page from plagarism checker algorithms. We will use a simple substring matching approach to carry out this analysis. Simply put, the method involves the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Breakdown each document into a series of n-grams.</strong> n should be a medium length, ~5 to 10 words. Too long, and it won’t capture situations where authors change one or two words. Too short, and we would miss word patterns. For this case, we choose n = 6.</li>
<li><strong>Calculate a similarity score</strong>, where 1 indicates that the entirety of document A is found in document B. The score is given by: <span class="math display">\[
similarity (\text{doc A to doc B}) = \frac{\text{no. of n-grams in doc A found in doc B}}{\text{total number of n-grams in doc A}}
\]</span></li>
<li>Noting that the score is directional (i.e. similarity of A to B may be 1, but if B is a longer document then similarity of B to A will be &lt; 1), we should designate the shorter document (higher similarity score) as the derivative source and the longer document (lower similarity score) as the primary. Not all forms of “Shadow Author” relationships will be so neat. From our manual review of the articles in the above sections, it is clear that some shadow authors “mix and match” paragraphs around. For simplicity, we will define a “Shadow Author” relationship based on the following:
<ul>
<li><strong>Links between documents are defined if at least one of the similarity scores is &gt;0.5.</strong> This allows for some coincidental overlaps in n-grams. &gt;0.5 similarity score means more than half of the n-grams in doc A can be found in doc B, and indicates that one of the articles might have been “shadow authored”.</li>
<li><strong>Document with the higher score will be designated as the derivative.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Document with the lower score will be designated as the primary.</strong></li>
<li>Where multiple documents are linked (similarity score &gt;0.1), the <strong>document with the lowest average similarity score will be designated as the primary source</strong>, and all others will be designated as derivative.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>The raw similiarity scores are not quite useful yet, we need to extract insight by determining which are the primary and derivative sources.</p>
<p>One interesting point to note, is the the n-gram method will be extremely useful in helping us to identify primary sources for the quoting relationships. This is because a quote from another article will show up as an n-gram similarity score (i.e. a few sentences or paragraphs matching the primary source). If the similarity score is very close to 1, then the article may be a reprint of an older article.</p>
<p>We incoprporate this insight into our analysis and use the n-gram similarity score to fill in the primary sources for our quoting relationships. A single article may quote multiple sources, so the rules for defining primary and derivative source is not the same as those for shadow authoring. We will instead check off all articles from the quoted news source that have some similarity with the derivative article (i.e. the article doing the quoting).</p>

</div>
<p>From Figure 1 above, it can be seen that the bulk of the similarity between sources is due to “Shadow Authoring”, where authors write for multiple news organisations without using their names. It is perhaps not surprising, given that Kronos is a very small country with a population of only 783,305 people, but supporting a media industry of 29 different news sources. From Figure 1, it appears that <em>News Online Today</em> is the biggest beneficiary of such shadow authoring, with primary sources ranging from <em>Homeland Illumination</em>, <em>International Times</em>, <em>Kronos Star</em>, <em>The Abila Post</em>, and <em>The World</em>. <em>News Online Today</em> appears to also be the largest single news agency in Kronos by article volume (see Figure 2 below), which probably indicates that they may also be one of the mainstream news sources in Kronos, which is why they are attractive to shadow writers.</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<p><img src="assignment_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="624" /></p>
</div>
<p>Assessing the types of relationships by author (see Figure 3 below), we find that most of the authors exclusively use shadow authoring, with only Petrus’ articles being reprinted with his name in other sources. Note that there are many articles without author names.</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<p><img src="assignment_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" width="624" /></p>
</div>
<p>One possible reason for this reluctance to explicitly declare their authorship could be that authors are deliberatly attempting to use a more reputable news source (e.g. News Online Today) to spread their message without compromising said news source by associating openly with it. Since 2005 (based on materials provided), the Protectors of Kronos (POK) have gotten increasingly militant and government crackdowns have similarly stepped up. Considering the political situation, we can compare the evolving dynamics of primary-derivative source relationships before 2005 and after 2005. From Figures 4a and 4b below, we can see that while shadow authoring relationships have always been prevalent, after 2005, no authors have published articles in other news sources under their own names any more.</p>

<p><em>Characterize any biases you identify in these news sources, with respect to their representation of specific people, places, and events. Give examples. Please limit your answer to 6 images and 500 words.</em></p>
<h2 id="solution-approach-and-data-wrangling-1">3.2.1. Solution Approach and Data Wrangling</h2>
<p>Visualising bias will require more in depth analysis of the article texts. We will used frequency-based analysis to characterise the articles for bias detection. First, we need to identify entities which we wish to study, namely:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Protectors of Kronos</li>
<li>Kronos Government</li>
<li>GAStech</li>
</ol>
<p>We will define some keywords to label our dataset accordingly. Articles will be indicated as making a representation about each of these entities if certain keywords are mentioned in the article.</p>

<p>Now, we turn our attention to the sentiment analysis.</p>
<p>First, we will convert our corpus of articles into a document-term matrix, using <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/tfidf.html">text frequency - inverse document frequency</a> (TF-IDF) to fill in the values. TF-IDF is used because it supresses words that appear commonly across all documents through the inverse document frequency term. This eliminates the need to specify stopwords to remove from the corpus, which is tedious and might not be too accurate as some stopwords also depend on the unique characteristics of each corpus.</p>
<p>We will also lemmatize the words using the <a href="https://rdrr.io/cran/textstem/">textstem</a> package to better capture the meaning of each document by converting various forms of words to their root word (e.g. ‘running’, ‘ran’, and ‘run’ will be reduced to ‘run’). Another approach is stemming, where t he ends of words are truncated based on heuristics to remove derivational and inflectional affixes (e.g. -s, -ed, -es, -ing, -tion). Past research (<a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2253/paper45.pdf">di Nanzio, Vezzani, 2018</a>) has shown that lemmatization and stemming are comparable in terms of performance. We will go with lemmatization for this project because the output are base words, which are more understandable.</p>
<p>We will also remove numerics so that we can avoid cluttering the document-term matrix and zoom in on word meanings to analyse sentiment.</p>

<p>We plot a wordcloud (see Figure 5 below) to compare the common words used when each of the three entities are mentioned in an article. From the word cloud, it can be seen that the words commonly used when talking about the government or GAStech are largely neutral, while those used in describing POK have more negative connotations (e.g. violence, vandalism, assault).</p>

<p><img src="assignment_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png" width="480" /></p>
</div>
<p>However, we now need to characterise the individual words in order to capture sentiment, so that we can apply an analysis on each news source to identify bias. Our approach will be as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Extract and manually annotate the vocabulary</strong> to characterise words as follows:
<ul>
<li>Negative to POK (e.g. terrorist, vandalism, riot, loot, criminal)</li>
<li>Positive to POK (e.g. activist, protest, demonstration, peaceful)</li>
<li>Negative to Government (e.g. favoritism, corruption, kleptocracy)</li>
<li>Positive to Government (e.g. investment, development)</li>
<li>Negative to GAStech (e.g. toxic, acidic, contamination)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For each set of entity mentions:
<ul>
<li><strong>Summarise the document-term matrix by news source</strong>, taking the column means to get the average sentiment of the articles produced by the news source mentioning said entity.</li>
<li><strong>Multiply the td-idf score for each word by the annotated word sentiment score</strong> (-1 for negative, 0 for neutral, 1 for positive).</li>
<li><strong>Sum the sentiment scores for all words for each news source.</strong> That will be the sentiment score for the news source.</li>
<li><strong>Normalise the sentiment scores, by computing the z-statistic.</strong> This is to ensure that the relative favorability of a news source for each entity is comparable across entities</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Visualise the relative favorability of each news source with respect to each entity.</strong></li>

<h3 id="answer-1">3.2.2. Answer</h3>
<p>Based on the results in Figure 6 below, we find that most news sources are more neutral in stance. In general there is greater variability in favorability for GAStech and POK, while favorability ratings for the government tend to be clustered in a tight band, indicating that most news sources tend to report objectively or slightly favorably on the government. This is perhaps to be expected, as the government is usually able to exert some influence over news media in a country.</p>
<p>It is noted that <em>Modern Rubicon</em> is the most vehemently anti-government news source, while it is also the most pro-POK news source. This is not surprising, and <em>Modern Rubicon</em> could have links with the POK organisation and senior leadership.</p>

<p>To validate our findings, let’s perform a wordcloud of <em>Modern Rubicon’s</em> articles regarding each entity and see what kind of words they tend to use regarding each entity.</p>
