<h1 id="task">1. Task</h1>
<p>The task is to use visual analytics to examine text data comprising: * news articles; * GAStech employee email headers; * GAStech employee records; and * GAStech employee resumes</p>
<p>in order to answer the following questions.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong> Characterize the news data sources provided. Which are primary sources and which are derivative sources? What are the relationships between the primary and derivative sources? Please limit your answer to 8 images and 300 words.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION 2:</strong> Characterize any biases you identify in these news sources, with respect to their representation of specific people, places, and events. Give examples. Please limit your answer to 6 images and 500 words.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION 3:</strong> Given the data sources provided, use visual analytics to identify potential official and unofficial relationships among GASTech, POK, the APA, and Government. Include both personal relationships and shared goals and objectives. Provide evidence for these relationships. Please limit your answer to 6 images and 400 words.</p>
<h1 id="data-preparation">2. Data Preparation</h1>
<p>Firstly, we will need to clean up and process the data into data tables to facilitate analysis. We will use a combination of R tools and manual inspection/editing to clean up the data.</p>
<p>There are three main datasets that will need to be processed and tidied up. The first set comprises the news articles. They will have to be collected into a data table for analysis, with key article details such as title, author, publish date, etc. extracted to facilitate analysis. The second set of data comprises the employee relationships to each other, as well as entities such as countries, organisations, persons outside GAStech, etc. The third and final set of data comprises email headers for two weeks worth of emails, along with labels of the type of emails.</p>
<h2 id="news-articles">2.1. News Articles</h2>
<p>There is noise in the news article data, which includes incosistent line breaks, inconsistent formatting of article details such as dates, author names, etc., and inconsistent details provided per article. This has to be taken into account in processing the article data.</p>
<h3 id="step-2.1.1-combine-articles-into-single-table-for-checking"><strong>Step 2.1.1:</strong> Combine articles into single table for checking</h3>
<p>We first begin by combining the article data into a single table to facilitate checks. We get the easy part out of the way and clean up the line breaks, by replacing all double line breaks with single line breaks with the code below.</p>

<h1 id="solutions-approach-answers">3. Solutions (Approach &amp; Answers)</h1>
<p>Using the prepared data, we now answer the questions with the help of some meaningful visualisations.</p>
<h2 id="question-1">3.1. Question 1</h2>
<p><em>Characterize the news data sources provided. Which are primary sources and which are derivative sources? What are the relationships between the primary and derivative sources? Please limit your answer to 8 images and 300 words.</em></p>
<h3 id="solution-approach-and-data-wrangling">3.1.1. Solution Approach and Data Wrangling</h3>
<p>There are two ways to detect derivative sources: 1. presence of other news source name in the text (e.g. quoting or crediting another news source) 2. same title and author as another article (e.g. reprinting or republishing a previous article from another news source)</p>
<p><strong>STEP 1:</strong> Identify presence of other news source name</p>
<p>For the first approach, we will establish a listing of all news sources, and then check each article text for the presence of other news sources. We will use the detects to generate an adjacency matrix to visualise the links between articles. The primary source will be the news source quoted and the derivative source is the article doing the quoting.</p>

<p>One quick observation that we can make is that there are several instances where articles share titles (i.e. exact match) with one combination with an author’s name indicated but another combination without an author’s name. This indicates that there might be situations either where one source is plagarising another or authors with one publication are re-using their work with another publication without using their bylines. We examine the text of the respective articles.</p>

Following the annual GAStech-Kronos corporate meeting GAStech executives and several high-ranking Kronos government officials will attend a soiree at the Kronos capital building to celebrate the unfettered kleptocracy that has kept Kronos public officials in mansions and luxury vehicles.\nWe at the Homeland Illumination look forward to hearing what President Kapelou II and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. have to say about how this unholy alliance has benefited the citizens of Kronos.  ","\nTwo years ago yesterday Elian Karel died at age 28 in an Abila jail cell, purportedly of cardiac arrest.  Kraft had reached an agreement with the government that charges would be reduced and the Karel be released pending a trial, but Karel died two days before he was to go free. \nQuestions linger, however, about the manner of Karel's death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police,  whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death, would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation.  After Karel's body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel's death stating that \"we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries.\"\nAs reported at the time of Karel's death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel's body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police. \nPolice have denied anything unusual happened in Karel's death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence. \nYesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water.   \n\"Both of them died because of government lies and corruption,\" one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.  \"Juliana died because Kronos allowed GAStech to poison our water, and Elian died because he tried to bring Juliana justice.\"\n","\nTwo years ago yesterday Elian Karel died at age 28 in an Abila jail cell, purportedly of cardiac arrest.  He had been arrested three months prior for spurious charges of tax evasion and left to linger in a jail cell without further legal action.  His attorney, Michale Kraft made several appearances in court demanding that the government outline their specific charges, and release Karel.  Kraft had reached an agreement with the government that charges would be reduced and the Karel be released pending a trial, but Karel died two days before he was to go free.\nQuestions linger, however, about the manner of Karel’s death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police –whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death – would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation.\nThis “thorough investigation” lasted all of two weeks, including the time it took the Abila City Coroner to lose the original autopsy files.  After Karel’s body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel’s death stating that “we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries.”\nAs reported at the time of Karel’s death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel’s body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police.  These confidential sources have since moved from the area and have been unavailable for contact.\nPolice have denied anything unusual happened in Karel’s death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence.\nYesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water.  \n“Both of them died because of government lies and corruption,” one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.  “Juliana died because Kronos allowed GAStech to poison our water, and Elian died because he tried to bring Juliana justice.  When will it end?”\nAnother, larger crowd had gathered the day before in a nearby city park to bring public awareness about these same issues.  Amid the speeches and music, I heard the same message from the year before:  “Remember Juliana! Remember Elian!”","\nKronos police arrested Elian Karel today on charges of tax evasion.  Karel, the leader of the activist group \"Protectors of Kronos\", was conducting a meeting with his supporters when he was arrested.  Karel's lawyer, Michale Kraft, released a statement declaring that the charges against his client were false and that he hoped to have Karel released from police custody by week's end.  It is clear that Elian Karel, who professes to have the interests of the people of Kronos at heart, must explain to us why he refuses to contribute to the welfare of his nation.\n","\nKronos police arrested Elian Karel today on charges of tax evasion.  Karel, the leader of the activist group \"Protectors of Kronos\", was conducting a meeting with his supporters when he was arrested.  Karel tried to make light of the situation, but his followers were clearly concerned about the seriousness of the charges leveled against him.  Karel's lawyer, Michale Kraft, released a statement declaring that the charges against his client were false and that he hoped to have Karel released from police custody by week's end.  In response to Kraft's statement, Police spokesman Adrien Carman said, \"I think Mr. Kraft has underestimated the seriousness of his client's situation.\"  It is clear that Elian Karel, who professes to have the interests of the people of Kronos at heart, must explain to us why he refuses to contribute to the welfare of his nation.","\nFive young people were arrested yesterday for protesting near the entrance to the Tiskele Bend fields as they called for government action to address their environmental concerns about GAStech's operations at the site.  The protestors, members of the activist group \"Protectors of Kronos\", held signs reading: \"Drilling Poisoned Our Water\" and \"Remember Juliana\", referring to 10 year old Juliana Vann, who has become an icon for the Protectors of Kronos since her death in 1998.  The protestors were arrested after one young man threw his sign at a government vehicle, cracking its window and startling the occupants.  Police spokesman Adrien Carman said of the arrests, \"We decided to shut the protest down before the POK members escalated to further violence.  \"The people of Kronos have overwhelmingly been for the development of our natural resources and all have benefited from the resultant economic growth.\n","\nFive young people were arrested yesterday for protesting near the entrance to the Tiskele Bend fields as they called for government action to address their environmental concerns about GAStech's operations at the site.

They were getting pretty animated out there.\"\n\"These 'Protectors of Kronos' are really a fringe minority of people against the extraction of fossils fuels in our country,\" said Government spokesman Carmine Gurganus.  \"The people of Kronos have overwhelmingly been for the development of our natural resources and all have benefited from the resultant economic growth.  These activists clearly don't understand the whole picture.\"\n","\nA motion to increase taxes on oil and gas development by an additional 10% was defeated today in the General Assembly by a vote of 77 to 23.

They handed out information on flyers printed and donated by local businesses about the lifestyle incongruities between today's elected officials and those of a few years ago. Demonstrators held posters of POK martyrs and chanted for social and economic parity, while black-clad members of the Abila Police formed faceless lines of shields, batons and side arms surrounding the crowds.  The rally had been publicized as a peaceful gathering of citizens to bring their concerns to the public consciousness.

<p>Briefly, from comparing some of the text in the above table, it appears that Petrus Gerhard is recycling articles that he writes for <em>Homeland Illumination</em> for <em>All News Today</em> (simply shortening the article and changing one or two words for <em>All News Today</em>), and often on the same day. Marcella Trapani and Eva Thayer are doing similar at <em>International News</em> while officially writing for <em>Kronos Star</em>. We will investigate this further using text analytics to quantify the similarity between articles.</p>
<p>Firstly, we will convert our corpus of articles into a document-term matrix, using <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/tfidf.html">text frequency - inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)</a> to fill in the values. TF-IDF is used because it supresses words that appear commonly across all documents through the inverse document frequency term. This eliminates the need to specify stopwords to remove from the corpus, which is tedious and might not be too accurate as some stopwords also depend on the unique characteristics of each corpus. We will also lemmatize the words using the <a href="https://rdrr.io/cran/textstem/">textstem</a> package to better capture the meaning of each document by converting various forms of words to their root word (e.g. ‘running’, ‘ran’, and ‘run’ will be reduced to ‘run’). Another approach is stemming, where t he ends of words are truncated based on heuristics to remove derivational and inflectional affixes (e.g. -s, -ed, -es, -ing, -tion). Past research (<a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2253/paper45.pdf">di Nanzio, Vezzani, 2018</a>) has shown that lemmatization and stemming are comparable in terms of performance. We will go with lemmatization for this project because the output are base words, which are more understandable.</p>
