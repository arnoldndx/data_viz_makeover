Task\r\nThe task is to use visual analytics to examine text data comprising:\r\nnews articles;\r\nGAStech employee email headers;\r\nGAStech employee records; and\r\nGAStech employee resumes\r\nin order to answer the following questions.\r\nQUESTION 1: Characterize the news data sources provided. Which are primary sources and which are derivative sources? What are the relationships between the primary and derivative sources? Please limit your answer to 8 images and 300 words.\r\nQUESTION 2: Characterize any biases you identify in these news sources, with respect to their representation of specific people, places, and events. Give examples. Please limit your answer to 6 images and 500 words.\r\nQUESTION 3: Given the data sources provided, use visual analytics to identify potential official and unofficial relationships among GASTech, POK, the APA, and Government. Include both personal relationships and shared goals and objectives. Provide evidence for these relationships. Please limit your answer to 6 images and 400 words.\r\n2. Literature Review and Methods\r\n2.1. Literature Review\r\nPast attempts at the VAST Challenge 2014, which uses the same dataset, was reviewed before attempting this assignment. The attempts were retrived from the VAST Challenge Visual Analytics Benchmark Repository hosted by the University of Maryland.\r\nFirstly, we noticed that most groups used alot of manual inspection of the text data, rather than more sophisticated text analysis. This is also why most groups spend upwards of 150 hours analysing the data to draw conclusions. As we are doing an individul and not a group assignment, our resources will be much more limited. For our analysis, we will attempt to use slightly more sophisticated analysis at of the text data at an aggregated level so as to draw some conclusions regarding the data more efficiently.\r\nTianJin University’s submission did present a more sophisticated cluster analysis of the news articles to identify media bias, but they did not provide details on how they approached the clustering. We will instead develop a new approach to our media bias analysis based on customised sentiment analysis.\r\nTo analyse the relationships between entities for part 3, most used variants of network graphs and Sankey diagrams. We will adopt a similar approach in analysing the relationships.\r\n2.2. R Packages used\r\nThe following R packages are used in this assignment:\r\nR Package\r\nUsage\r\ntidyverse, formatR, gbutils\r\nUtilities for data wrangling\r\nlubridate, clock\r\nUtilities to manage dates\r\nDT, kableExtra\r\nTo produce data tables for viewing data\r\ntidytext, readtext, textstem, tm, slam\r\nUtilities for text data wrangling and matrix multiplications\r\ngraphics, ggrepel, RcolorBrewer\r\nUtilities for graph plotting\r\nggalluvial\r\nPlotting Sankey/Alluvial plots\r\nwordcloud\r\nPlotting wordclouds\r\nvisNetwork\r\nPlotting network graphs\r\n3. Data Preparation\r\nFirstly, we will need to clean up and process the data into data tables to facilitate analysis. We will use a combination of R tools and manual inspection/editing to clean up the data.\r\nThere are three main datasets that will need to be processed and tidied up. The first set comprises the news articles. They will have to be collected into a data table for analysis, with key article details such as title, author, publish date, etc. extracted to facilitate analysis. The second set of data comprises the employee relationships to each other, as well as entities such as countries, organisations, persons outside GAStech, etc. The third and final set of data comprises email headers for two weeks worth of emails, along with labels of the type of emails.\r\n3.1. News Articles\r\nThere is noise in the news article data, which includes incosistent line breaks, inconsistent formatting of article details such as dates, author names, etc., and inconsistent details provided per article. This has to be taken into account in processing the article data.\r\n3.1.1. Combine articles into single table for checking\r\nWe first begin by combining the article data into a single table to facilitate checks. We get the easy part out of the way and clean up the line breaks, by replacing all double line breaks with single line breaks with the code below.\r\n\r\n\r\narticles <- readtext(\"MC 1/News Articles/*\")\r\n\r\nfor (row in 1:nrow(articles)) {\r\n    # clean up the text of breaks\r\n    while (str_detect(articles[row, \"text\"],\r\n        \"\\n \")) {\r\n        articles[row, \"text\"] <- str_replace_all(articles[row,\r\n            \"text\"], \"\\n \", \"\\n\")\r\n    }\r\n    while (str_detect(articles[row, \"text\"],\r\n        \"\\n\\n\")) {\r\n        articles[row, \"text\"] <- str_replace_all(articles[row,\r\n            \"text\"], \"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\")\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe then export the data for manual cleaning (i.e. edit the text directly in the csv file).\r\n\r\n\r\n# export data for manual cleaning\r\nwrite.csv(articles, \"article_consol.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.1.2. Load cleaned data and convert to article data into analysable dataframe\r\nWe now begin the task of converting the data into an analysable format.\r\nFirst, we perform a first pass manual check of all the article text and manually clean up the data into a consistent format.Then we load in the cleaned data.\r\n\r\n\r\n# load in cleaned data\r\narticle_data <- read.csv(\"article_consol_edit.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, we convert the article data into an analysable dataframe to with the relevant article information separated out. We also ensure that the published dates are properly formatted for analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n# create dataframe to store article\r\n# data\r\narticle_df <- data_frame(doc_id = rep(\"\",\r\n    nrow(article_data)), source = rep(\"\",\r\n    nrow(article_data)), title = rep(\"\",\r\n    nrow(article_data)), author = rep(\"\",\r\n    nrow(article_data)), location = rep(\"\",\r\n    nrow(article_data)), published = rep(\"\",\r\n    nrow(article_data)), text = rep(\"\", nrow(article_data)))\r\n\r\n# define the article details to be\r\n# captured\r\nheaders <- c(\"source\", \"title\", \"author\",\r\n    \"location\", \"published\")\r\n\r\nfor (row in 1:nrow(article_data)) {\r\n    article_text <- str_split(article_data$text[row],\r\n        \"\\n\")\r\n    article_df$doc_id[row] <- article_data$doc_id[row]\r\n    for (i in 1:length(article_text[[1]])) {\r\n        detail <- str_trim(str_split_fixed(article_text[[1]][i],\r\n            \":\", 2))\r\n        # check if any of the string\r\n        # headers corresponds to\r\n        # article details, otherwise\r\n        # treat as body text\r\n        if (tolower(detail[1]) %in% headers) {\r\n            # some of the article text\r\n            # has 'LOCATION:',\r\n            # especially police blotter\r\n            # transcripts, this is to\r\n            # make sure only the first\r\n            # instance of location is\r\n            # used.\r\n            if (article_df[row, tolower(detail[1])] ==\r\n                \"\") {\r\n                # for multiple authors\r\n                # store authors as list\r\n                # so that they can be\r\n                # referenced separately\r\n                if (tolower(detail[1]) ==\r\n                  \"author\") {\r\n                  article_df[row, tolower(detail[1])] <- list(str_trim(str_split(detail[2],\r\n                    \",\")))\r\n                } else if (tolower(detail[1]) ==\r\n                  \"published\") {\r\n                  date <- str_replace_all(str_replace_all(detail[2],\r\n                    \"  \", \" \"), \",\", \"\")\r\n                  article_df[row, \"published\"] <- date\r\n                }\r\n                article_df[row, tolower(detail[1])] <- str_trim(detail[2])\r\n            } else {\r\n                # concatenate body text\r\n                article_df[row, \"text\"] <- paste(article_df[row,\r\n                  \"text\"], article_text[[1]][i],\r\n                  sep = \"\\n\")\r\n            }\r\n        } else {\r\n            # concatenate body text\r\n            article_df[row, \"text\"] <- paste(article_df[row,\r\n                \"text\"], article_text[[1]][i],\r\n                sep = \"\\n\")\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n# convert the published dates to dates\r\narticle_df$published <- as.Date(parse_date_time(article_df$published,\r\n    c(\"dmy\", \"mdy\", \"ymd\")))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd we’re done with the news article data!\r\n3.2. GAStech employee data\r\nThe GAStech employee data is already neatly captured in tabular form and will not need significant pre-processing. Just load it in!\r\n\r\n\r\nemployee_data <- read.csv(\"MC 1/EmployeeRecords.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.3. Email headers\r\nWe will load in the email data and expand the email headers list. Every row should be a unique combination of individual sender, individual recipient, and subject. This will facilitate network analysis later.\r\n\r\n\r\nemail_header <- read_csv(\"MC 1/email headers.csv\")\r\n\r\n# note that row 553 has an error in the\r\n# date time, impute a time\r\nemail_header$Date[553] <- \"1/13/2014 9:00\"\r\n\r\nemail_header_proc <- c(\"source\", \"target\",\r\n    \"sent_date\", \"sent_time\", \"subject\")\r\n\r\n# convert email headers to a processed\r\n# dataframe\r\nfor (i in 1:nrow(email_header)) {\r\n    # parse the date times\r\n    date <- format(mdy_hm(email_header$Date[i]),\r\n        \"%Y-%m-%d\")\r\n    time <- format(mdy_hm(email_header$Date[i]),\r\n        \"%I:%M:%S %p\")\r\n    # create a new row for each\r\n    # recepient\r\n    for (j in 1:length(str_split(email_header[i,\r\n        2], \",\")[[1]])) {\r\n        source <- email_header[i, 1]\r\n        target <- str_trim(str_split(email_header[i,\r\n            2], \",\")[[1]][j])\r\n        sent_date <- date\r\n        sent_time <- time\r\n        subject <- email_header[i, 4]\r\n        new_row <- c(source, target, sent_date,\r\n            sent_time, subject)\r\n        email_header_proc <- rbind(email_header_proc,\r\n            new_row)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n# remove top row\r\nemail_header_proc <- email_header_proc[-1,\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n# reset rownames and colnames\r\nrownames(email_header_proc) <- c(1:nrow(email_header_proc))\r\ncolnames(email_header_proc) <- c(\"source\",\r\n    \"target\", \"sent_date\", \"sent_time\", \"subject\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd we’re done with email headers!\r\n4. Solutions (Approach & Answers)\r\nUsing the prepared data, we now answer the questions with the help of some meaningful visualisations.\r\n4.1. QUESTION 1\r\nCharacterize the news data sources provided. Which are primary sources and which are derivative sources? What are the relationships between the primary and derivative sources? Please limit your answer to 8 images and 300 words.\r\n4.1.1. Solution Approach and Data Wrangling\r\nThere are two ways to detect derivative sources:\r\npresence of other news source name in the text (e.g. quoting or crediting another news source)\r\nsame title and author as another article (e.g. reprinting or republishing a previous article from another news source)\r\nSTEP 1: Identify presence of other news source name\r\nFor the first approach, we will establish a listing of all news sources, and then check each article text for the presence of other news sources. We will use the detects to generate an adjacency matrix to visualise the links between articles. The relationship will be defined as follows:\r\nThe primary source will be the news source quoted\r\nThe derivative source is the article doing the quoting\r\nThe relationship is defined as “Quoting”\r\n\r\n\r\nnews_sources <- c(unique(article_df$source))\r\n\r\n# append one column for each news\r\n# source to article df to establish an\r\n# adjacency matrix\r\narticle_df[news_sources] <- NA\r\n\r\n# mark TRUE whenever mentions of other\r\n# news sources are detected\r\nfor (row in 1:nrow(article_df)) {\r\n    for (news_source in news_sources) {\r\n        if (article_df[row, \"source\"] !=\r\n            news_source) {\r\n            article_df[row, news_source] <- str_detect(article_df[row,\r\n                \"text\"], news_source)\r\n        } else {\r\n            article_df[row, news_source] <- FALSE\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n# convert the adjacency matrix into a\r\n# list of edges (primary doc_id,\r\n# primary source, derivative doc_id,\r\n# derivative source, edge type)\r\nedge_list_quote <- article_df[, c(1:2, 8:36)] %>%\r\n    pivot_longer(cols = !c(doc_id, source),\r\n        names_to = \"primary_source\")\r\n\r\n# filter out the 'False' (i.e. no\r\n# links)\r\nedge_list_quote <- edge_list_quote %>%\r\n    filter(value)\r\n\r\n# remove the 'value' column\r\nedge_list_quote <- edge_list_quote[, c(1:3)]\r\n\r\n# add the additional edge details\r\nedge_list_quote$primary_doc_id <- \"\"  #no doc_ids for quoted source, unfortunately\r\nedge_list_quote$type <- \"Quoting\"\r\n\r\n# rename the columns\r\nedge_list_quote <- edge_list_quote %>%\r\n    rename(derivative_doc_id = doc_id, derivative_source = source)\r\n\r\n# reorder the columns\r\nedge_list_quote <- edge_list_quote[, c(4,\r\n    3, 1, 2, 5)]\r\n\r\n# remove adjacency matrix from\r\n# article_df\r\narticle_df <- article_df[, 1:7]\r\n\r\n# rename the rows in article_df to\r\n# doc_id for easier referencing\r\nrownames(article_df) <- article_df$doc_id\r\n\r\nedge_list_quote %>%\r\n    kbl(caption = \"List of \\\"Quoting\\\" relationships\",\r\n        col.names = c(\"Primary doc ID\", \"Primary news source\",\r\n            \"Derivative document ID\", \"Derivative news source\",\r\n            \"Relationship Type\")) %>%\r\n    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\",\r\n        \"hover\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1: List of “Quoting” relationships\r\n\r\n\r\nPrimary doc ID\r\n\r\n\r\nPrimary news source\r\n\r\n\r\nDerivative document ID\r\n\r\n\r\nDerivative news source\r\n\r\n\r\nRelationship Type\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHomeland Illumination\r\n\r\n\r\n154.txt\r\n\r\n\r\nAll News Today\r\n\r\n\r\nQuoting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHomeland Illumination\r\n\r\n\r\n391.txt\r\n\r\n\r\nAll News Today\r\n\r\n\r\nQuoting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHomeland Illumination\r\n\r\n\r\n342.txt\r\n\r\n\r\nNews Online Today\r\n\r\n\r\nQuoting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHomeland Illumination\r\n\r\n\r\n4.txt\r\n\r\n\r\nNews Online Today\r\n\r\n\r\nQuoting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHomeland Illumination\r\n\r\n\r\n511.txt\r\n\r\n\r\nNews Online Today\r\n\r\n\r\nQuoting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe World\r\n\r\n\r\n713.txt\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Abila Post\r\n\r\n\r\nQuoting\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are only six quoting relationships detected in Step 1. We will see if we can derive more insight from the data in Step 2.\r\nSTEP 2: Identify articles with same title and author\r\nFirst we compile a list of unique title-author combinations and extract the earliest publication of each combination. This list will be the basis for comparison against all the articles. Any articles published after the earliest publication is necessarily a reprint of the primary source.\r\n\r\n\r\n#establish a list of unique article title/author combinations and record the earliest publish date and the source\r\n\r\narticle_df_grouped <-  article_df %>%\r\n  group_by(title,author) %>%\r\n  arrange(published, by_group = TRUE) %>%\r\n  summarise(first_doc_id = first(doc_id), \r\n            published = first(published), \r\n            news_source = first(source),\r\n            text = first(text),\r\n            #the below details are for further analysis\r\n            count = n(), #count the number of times the title-author combo been published\r\n            all_source = list(unique(source)), #list the number of news sources that have used this article\r\n            all_doc = list(doc_id)) #list all the documents that share this article-author combination\r\n\r\ndatatable(article_df_grouped[,c(1:5,7:9)],\r\n          class = 'cell-border stripe',\r\n          caption = 'TABLE 2.

observation that we can make is that there are several instances where articles share titles (i.e. exact match) with one combination with an author’s name indicated but another combination without an author’s name. This indicates that there might be situations either where one source is plagarising another or authors with one publication are re-using their work with another publication without using their bylines.\r\nTo further investigate this we shall extract the text of all articles which share the same title for comparison. We should note that if there is only one news source that has used this title (even if there are multiple articles), then this article could be a topic header for a developing story, with periodic updates being provided.

Kraft had reached an agreement with the government that charges would be reduced and the Karel be released pending a trial, but Karel died two days before he was to go free. \\nQuestions linger, however, about the manner of Karel's death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police,  whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death, would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation.  After Karel's body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel's death stating that \\\"we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries.\\\"\\nAs reported at the time of Karel's death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel's body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police. \\nPolice have denied anything unusual happened in Karel's death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence. \\nYesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water.   \\n\\\"Both of them died because of government lies and corruption,\\\" one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.  \\\"Juliana died because Kronos allowed GAStech to poison our water, and Elian died because he tried to bring Juliana justice.\\\"\\n \\n\",\"DOC_ID:  633.txt \\n SOURCE:  News Online Today \\n AUTHOR:   \\n PUBLISHED:  20-01-2014 \\n LOCATION:  ABILA, Kronos \\n \\n \\nAbila Airport fueler Ravi Danisliau confirmed that two private jets took off today after being fueled.  \\nThe second plane also carried seven or eight \\\"business types\\\", but seemed \\\"much more relaxed than the first group of passengers\\\".

Investigators are awaiting toxicology reports to determine the cause of his death. Citywide, several deaths have been attributed to \\\"Cotton Candy\\\" according to the Kronos National Poison Center.\\nPatients are coming to Abila General from throughout the greater city region, and they include adults and youths, male and female, and all socio-economic backgrounds, Bianca said.\\nSgt Antonio Arresta of the Abila Fire Department, a first-responder to emergency medical calls in the city, said his department has also seen a spike in the number of people needing treatment for complications from designer drugs. \\\"We went from zero calls to a handful of calls\\\" in the last month,\\\" he said.\\nBianca and Arresta said their efforts to treat people is made more difficult because they often do not know anything about the designer drugs that were taken.\\n\\\"You don't know what you're getting when you get it,\\\" Bianca said. \\\"We have had patients come in and act out of control, who are very violent. They tell us they have been doing cotton candy or synthetic marijuana.\\\"\\nBianca said there is little clinical data on the effects of cotton candy, as it is an emerging toxicant. \\\"There are no controlled studies in toxicology,\\\" she said. The national poison center collects anecdotal reports on overdoses from hospitals and other providers as part of efforts to offer advice on how to treat patients.\\nDesigner drugs are chemical compounds synthesized to resemble the active ingredient in often illegal drugs. Cotton candy mimics the drug khat, a stimulant. Manufacturers frequently change the designer drug's chemical composition and its name to stay one step ahead of authorities, Biance said. \\\"It is another way to sell it,\\\" she said.\\nThe term cotton candy, for example, is a nickname of the drug and has nothing to do with the carnival treat. The drug has been sold under the name of \\\"Spice Dreams\\\" one week and under the name of \\\"Tulip Blossom\\\" the next. \\nThe Kronos government has placed three of the chemicals commonly used in the creation of cotton candy on its controlled substance list, criminalizing their use and possession. Still, the government cannot outright ban cotton candy because manufacturers can alter the recipe and skirt the law, Bianca said. The drugs are sold online as \\\"herbal therapy\\\" products and are available over the counter in area stores.\\n\\\"We still don't know what you are getting with cotton candy. The chemical composition varies from package to package,\\\" Bianca said.\\nOne factor for the popularity of cotton candy is its low cost, Bianca said. She said a gram of cotton candy costs about K18 while a gram of cocaine costs K166.\\nCotton candy creates euphoria, or a high, that is equal to or greater than that of cocaine but also causes a crash that is worse, Bianca said. The crash's ill-effects often prompt people to binge on cotton candy to the point where they consume the drug for days. \\\"They crave it,\\\" she said.\\nAfter repeated use, the drug \\\"fries\\\" a person's brain, draining the chemicals that balance its operations. This sometimes leads to bizarre, often psychotic behavior that has been reported in the media, such as the case of the naked man in Elodis who was found running down the middle of a major highway, Bianca said. \\\"The seizures and delusions are incredible,\\\" she said.\\nWhile it is not yet certain who is behind the distribution of this round of designer drugs, police suspect organized crime is pursuing this large income source. The Asterian People's Army has traditionally been involved with drug trafficking throughout the region, and enforcement agencies are closely examining possible cooperation between drug trafficking organizations and political insurgent groups.\\n \\n\",\"DOC_ID:  282.txt \\n SOURCE:  International Times \\n AUTHOR:   \\n PUBLISHED:  20-06-2012 \\n LOCATION:   \\n \\n \\nTraffic snarled around the city as Abilians struggle to get to work amid vandalism and looting\\nEarly on Tuesday police stormed the front of the presidential mansion and the capital building, breaking up a sit in by the Protectors of Kronos.\\nOther activist groups have joined the protesting faction in solidarity and a bigger rally was predicted for later in the day.\\nThe conservative Kronos government used an emergency law to threaten the protestors with arrest unless they dispersed and returned to work.

In Tethys a few years ago, I journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of Tethys to look at a contentious new energy producing area.\\nOne of the sites I visited was a local office of the Sanjorge Gas company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation. As I remember it, a former trucker was in charge.\\nIt was a vivid example of how a once small exploration company from Thethys had begun to grow into a mighty international force in the energy industry.\\nBut I'd forgotten about the encounter until I went back to Tethys the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: one man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it.\\nBut as I went round the capital city of Centrum interviewing people, I soon realised that this was not just a story of new energy. Something very significant has happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas industry expertise. From what's developed in the capital city there are important lessons for other places blessed (and cursed) with abundant natural resources.\\n\\\"Centrum developed world class expertise in engineering in very difficult surroundings\\\"\\nWhen I was a young newspaperman on the Daily Record in Glasgow in the early 1970s, the great off-shore oil rush was beginning in the North Sea. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, turning an island of coal into a place with abundant oil and gas supplies.\\nIt seemed to us on the west coast of Scotland that the far flung city of Centrum, Tethys was getting a bit big for its boots, starting to believe in a new fantasy industry.\\nMuch to his mother's regrets, meanwhile, Sten Sanjorge had started prospecting in the early 1960s.\\nBy the early 1970s, a new gas company, GAStech, began its juggernaut-like advances.\\nUnder his canny guidance, GAStech evolved into a major supplier of natural gas to the local region, and then much further afield. It now has thousands employees and operates in numerous countries. \\nThe change in Centrum has been substantial.  You notice them in the constant clutter of helicopters to-ing and fro-ing out to remote areas, and the planes lined up at the city's airport to shuttle execs back and forth from the city.\\nAnd as you drive round Centrum, almost every roundabout is sponsored by a division of GAStech. \\nSanjorge has recently started paying more attention to leisure activities and philanthropy, allowing his son Sten Jr. and co-founder Hank Fluss to run the company. But Sanjorge has just been asked to produce a report for the Tethan government recommending the best ways of ensuring that Tethys continues to produce energy for decades to come.\\nThe easy-to-get stuff has been produced, so keeping the gas coming will need much investment and more clever new techniques, such as the hyper-acidic substrate removal techniques developed by the company in 1974. \\nSo thanks to clever people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, Centrum has achieved what every place where raw materials are discovered longs to do. The city has taken the temporary boon of energy on its doorstep, and turned it into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which may make Centrum a centre of gas expertise long after the gas itself runs out.\\n \\n\",\"DOC_ID:  314.txt \\n SOURCE:  News Online Today \\n AUTHOR:   \\n PUBLISHED:  30-03-1995 \\n LOCATION:  CENTRUM, Tethys \\n \\n \\nGAStech International's Hyper Acidic Substrate Removal (HASR) has officially been banned by the Tethys government due to the high probability of water contamination.\\n \\n\",\"DOC_ID:  389.txt \\n SOURCE:  News Online Today \\n AUTHOR:   \\n PUBLISHED:  15-05-2011 \\n LOCATION:  ABILA, Kronos \\n \\n \\nAn alarming new trend is sweeping Abila.  \\nThe concerns over the increase of drug related arrests are two-fold: first, violent activist groups such as the Protectors of Kronos could be using drug sales as a means to fund their activities;\\n \\n\",\"DOC_ID:  554.txt \\n SOURCE:  All News Today \\n AUTHOR:   \\n PUBLISHED:  20-06-2009 \\n LOCATION:  ABILA, Kronos \\n \\n \\nElian Karel, age 28, died Friday while unlawfully incarcerated at the Abila City Prison.

This article is the first installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos. \\nELODIS, Kronos - Nestled in the bend of the Tiskele River, the sun rises over the farming town of Elodis,  chasing away the shadows cloaking nearby Mt.  Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos. \\nTwo weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around Tiskele Bend.  \\\"The gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away. \\nThe change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out of Tethys. \\nEstablished in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis. \\nWith a population of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a cafe. Here you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations. \\n\\\"We've made a good living for a long time,\\\" Reese tells me. \\nI asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech's operations.   \\nI caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at the Osvaldo hardware store to repair a broken tractor.

Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm.\\n\\\"We've worked the land for a long time - maybe 200 years, maybe a bit more,\\\" Henk Bodrogi told me as he picked over a container of bolts, searching for the right size.  \\\"Over the years we've added a few hectares here and there.  It keeps us busy.\\\"\\nBusy is an understatement, as I found when I prodded the wiry farmer to tell me more.\\n\\\"I usually head to the fields before sun up,\\\" Mr. Henk Bodrogi tells me. \\\"My wife gets the kids up and heading to school, then she'll make a little something for us to eat for lunch and work alongside me until dinner.  When the children get home from school they do their chores, and we're all back at the house most times by dark.\\\"\\n\\\"We do this most days,\\\" he adds, \\\"except for worship days.\\\"\\nBodrogi identifies the appropriate bolt and chats with the cashier about kids and school as he completes his purchase.\\n\\\"We all know one another here,\\\" Bodrogi explains as we leave. \\\"Most families have lived here for generations.  The first new people that came to town were with that gas company that built a few years back.\\\"\\nI ask Bodrogi if business has been good. \\n\\\"We were doing pretty good until recently.  Profits were good and we add acreage, or upgrade equipment.  Then we started having all this trouble with the crops.\\\"\\nIn what way, I asked.\\n\\\"The crops aren't producing like they have in the past.  It took a while to figure out, then one of the city officers figured out to call in a water specialist.  When they tested it they said the water was contaminated.\\\"\\nBodrodgi sighed, and with a beleaguered look in his eye he thanked me for my interest and told me he had to head back home.  The tractor had to be fixed before they could work the next day.  I thanked him and watched him climb into his truck and head out of town.\\nThe water specialist turned out to be the international agency \\\"Wellness For All\\\", an international agency with a mission to bring healthy water to communities distressed by natural disasters, draught and - coincidentally - oil and gas development.\\nI caught up with a representative from Wellness for All the next day.  Joclyn Reynolds is project coordinator for \\\"Wellness for All\\\".  She spoke to me over a satellite call from her field office in Southeast Asia where she was setting up relief efforts following an earthquake. Ms. Reynolds agreed to speak to me for a few minutes between meetings about their work in Elodis.\\n\\\"We were contacted by a city official about a problem they were having with their local water.  In the last few years agriculture had foundered, and the incidence of certain illnesses and birth defects had risen.  The Elodis drinking water comes from the Tiskele River, as does all the water for farming, so we looked for a source upstream.  We found sources of production waste disposal at the GAStech operation upstream.  Tests showed high levels of benzene, toluene, xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, among other toxins. \\\"\\n\\\"Can these substances occur naturally?\\\" I asked her.\\n\\\"Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly.  Groundwater contamination is usually the result of human activity.  The GAStech pipes are releasing contaminants into a pond.  The toxins are forming a subsurface plume that seeps into the Tiskele River from which the residents of Elodis draw their drinking water and irrigation for the crops.\\\"\\n\\\"Did you talk to GAStech about this?\\\"\\n\\\"Oh yes,\\\" she replied.  \\\"At first we believed we were gaining traction.  We met several times with GAStech representatives, including one of the senior executives, Hank Fluss.  He personally assured us GAStech would act responsibly to provide material and financial assistance toward cleanup efforts.  After a time, though, it became clear that while Mr. Fluss was earnest it was Sanjorge who makes the decisions.  It is apparent that he [Sanjorge] has no interest in the wellbeing of the residents of Elodis, or the environment.\\\"\\nSten Sanjorge, Jr., who had inherited his share in the company from his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for cutthroat business practices.\\n\\\"When we didn't make headway with GAStech,\\\" Reynolds continued, \\\"the community leaders decided to approach the government of Kronos for assistance.   Per our policy -and with permission from the Elodis leaders - we published the test results in an official public document.  The Elodis leaders then approached the government officials as citizens of a Kronesian community armed with the scientific analysis.  Our agency assured them we would again be available to help in any way when those agreements were finalized.\\\"\\nAt this point Ms Reynolds was called away from the phone, so I returned to my editor friend, Pondo Reese to tell finish the story.\\nPart Three will be published May 15, 1998 \\n\",\"DOC_ID:  237.txt \\n SOURCE:  All News Today \\n AUTHOR:   \\n PUBLISHED:  15-05-1998 \\n LOCATION:   \\n \\n \\nNOTE: This article is the last installment of a three\\nThis article is the last installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos.

The Government of Kronos officially refuted the claim citing the fragmentation of the WFA organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted. Regardless, Juliana became the POK's first martyr and has used Juliana's image on campaign literature ever since.  \\nThe POK's second major martyr is Elian Karel, who died in 2009 while incarcerated of undetermined causes. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion. Karel had been involved with the POK since its inception given that his father, Jeroen Karel, was an original member.  \\nThe POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people. As of 2011, the Government of Kronos has labeled the POK as a \\\"public threat\\\".\\n \\n\",\"DOC_ID:  341.txt \\n SOURCE:  All News Today \\n AUTHOR:   \\n PUBLISHED:  21-06-2013 \\n LOCATION:  ABILA, Kronos \\n \\n \\nABILA, Kronos - Yesterday, as they have each June 19th for the past three years supporters, of Protectors of Kronos rallied demanding much the same as they have in the past fourteen years:  an end to the corruption of the Kronos government officials and the cleanup of the toxic waste dump that has become the Tiskele River near Elodis.

Citywide, several deaths have been attributed to \\\"Cotton Candy\\\" according to the Kronos National Poison Center. \\nDesigner drugs are chemical compounds synthesized to resemble the active ingredient in often illegal drugs. Cotton candy mimics the drug khat, a stimulant. Manufacturers frequently change the designer drug's chemical composition and its name to stay one step ahead of authorities, Biance said. \\nThe term cotton candy, for example, is a nickname of the drug and has nothing to do with the carnival treat.  \\nThe Kronos government has placed three of the chemicals commonly used in the creation of cotton candy on its controlled substance list, criminalizing their use and possession. Still, the government cannot outright ban cotton candy because manufacturers can alter the recipe and skirt the law, Bianca said.

The crash's ill-effects often prompt people to binge on cotton candy to the point where they consume the drug for days.

Bouro.  Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos.\\nTwo weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around Tiskele Bend. In his email he described a once bountiful region now distressed by contamination, struggling to find solutions to a worsening problem.  I decided to investigate.\\n\\\"We didn't make the connection at first,\\\" Reese told me when I met with him at his office.  \\\"The gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away.   After a couple of harvests, we saw a decline in the production.   We thought perhaps it was just a hiccup, and things would get better.  Then when the kids started getting sick we took a harder look at what could have changed.\\\"\\nThe change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out of Tethys.\\nEstablished in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis.\\nWith a population of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a café where you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations.\\n\\\"We've made a good living for a long time,\\\" Reese tells me. \\\"The population has been steadily increasing.  Crop production has been good.  For the most part, kids haven't left for the city as they have in a lot of other rural places.  We have a lot of land that could yet be developed. There was a future for them here.\\\"\\nI asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech's operations.  He introduced me to a farmer whose family had been here for several generations.  \\nI caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at the Osvaldo hardware store to repair a broken tractor.

He believes there are large volumes of offshore gas that could be extracted. \\n\\\"Certainly offshore gas isn't a new concept, but there's no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can't develop these resources offshore,\\\" he told the Times. \\nShale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within. \\nHyper-acidic substrate removal has produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the West, transforming the energy market. \\nSanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited. \\nBased on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech's estimates for its onshore resources. \\nGAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore. \\nThough it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done. \\nProfessor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term. \\n\\\"GAStech is being optimistic is its estimates of how long it will take to explore offshore shale.

But not only who are they, what and why are they protesting? \\nThe Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis on the advice of the now defunct Wellness for All (WFA), an international water safety group. The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts that GAStech International's Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis. \\nIn 1998, WFA performed testing on the water of Elodis finding high levels of benzene, toluene and xylene arsenic, barium, chromium, lead and selenium. The testing a subsequent statement released by WFA brought international attention and pressure on the government and GAStech to act. However, with the fragmenting of WFA due to funding issues, the POK's demands were largely ignored and downplayed. \\nAlso in 1998, Juliana Vann, a previously healthy ten-year old girl died of a lingering illness, which WFA-funded doctors claimed was caused by water contamination. The Government of Kronos officially refuted the claim citing the fragmentation of the WFA organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted. Regardless, Juliana became the POK's first martyr and has used Juliana's image on campaign literature ever since. \\nThe POK's second major martyr is Elian Karel, who died in 2009 while incarcerated of undetermined causes. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion. Karel had been involved with the POK since its inception given that his father, Jeroen Karel, was an original member.  Elian Karel's death in 2009 was marked by spontaneous instances of protest around Abila. The anniversary of his death, June 19, has seen additional protests, demonstrations, riots, and violence. \\nThe POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people.

Marcella Trapani and Eva Thayer are doing similar at International News while officially writing for Kronos Star. There are many other cases, indicating that this “Shadow Author” phenomenon is probably much more widespread than previously expected. This warrants deeper investigation!!\r\nTo detect “Shadow Author” relationships, we will borrow a page from plagarism checker algorithms. We will use a simple substring matching approach to carry out this analysis. Simply put, the method involves the following:\r\nBreakdown each document into a series of n-grams. n should be a medium length, ~5 to 10 words. Too long, and it won’t capture situations where authors change one or two words. Too short, and we would miss word patterns. For this case, we choose n = 6.\r\nCalculate a similarity score, where 1 indicates that the entirety of document A is found in document B. The score is given by: \\[\r\nsimilarity (\\text{doc A to doc B}) = \\frac{\\text{no. of n-grams in doc A found in doc B}}{\\text{total number of n-grams in doc A}}\r\n\\]\r\nNoting that the score is directional (i.e. similarity of A to B may be 1, but if B is a longer document then similarity of B to A will be < 1), we should designate the shorter document (higher similarity score) as the derivative source and the longer document (lower similarity score) as the primary. Not all forms of “Shadow Author” relationships will be so neat. From our manual review of the articles in the above sections, it is clear that some shadow authors “mix and match” paragraphs around. For simplicity, we will define a “Shadow Author” relationship based on the following:\r\nLinks between documents are defined if at least one of the similarity scores is >0.5. This allows for some coincidental overlaps in n-grams. >0.5 similarity score means more than half of the n-grams in doc A can be found in doc B, and indicates that one of the articles might have been “shadow authored”.\r\nDocument with the higher score will be designated as the derivative.\r\nDocument with the lower score will be designated as the primary.\r\nWhere multiple documents are linked (similarity score >0.1), the document with the lowest average similarity score will be designated as the primary source, and all others will be designated as derivative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# breakdown the article text into\r\n# n-grams 'fingerprints'\r\nngram_fp <- article_df[, c(\"doc_id\", \"text\")] %>%\r\n    unnest_tokens(n - gram, text, token = \"ngrams\",\r\n        n = 6)\r\n\r\nngram_fp$count = 1\r\n\r\n# create 'n-gram'-document matrix\r\nndm <- ngram_fp %>%\r\n    cast_tdm(n - gram, doc_id, count)\r\n\r\n# calculate the similarity score\r\nfp_similarity_mat <- crossprod_simple_triplet_matrix(ndm)/col_sums(ndm)\r\n\r\n# create a reference similarity matrix\r\nfp_similiarity_mat_ref <- fp_similarity_mat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe raw similiarity scores are not quite useful yet, we need to extract insight by determining which are the primary and derivative sources.\r\nOne interesting point to note, is the the n-gram method will be extremely useful in helping us to identify primary sources for the quoting relationships. This is because a quote from another article will show up as an n-gram similarity score (i.e. a few sentences or paragraphs matching the primary source). If the similarity score is very close to 1, then the article may be a reprint of an older article.\r\nWe incoprporate this insight into our analysis and use the n-gram similarity score to fill in the primary sources for our quoting relationships. A single article may quote multiple sources, so the rules for defining primary and derivative source is not the same as those for shadow authoring.

Answer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Figure 1 above, it can be seen that the bulk of the similarity between sources is due to “Shadow Authoring”, where authors write for multiple news organisations without using their names. It is perhaps not surprising, given that Kronos is a very small country with a population of only 783,305 people, but supporting a media industry of 29 different news sources. From Figure 1, it appears that News Online Today is the biggest beneficiary of such shadow authoring, with primary sources ranging from Homeland Illumination, International Times, Kronos Star, The Abila Post, and The World. News Online Today appears to also be the largest single news agency in Kronos by article volume (see Figure 2 below), which probably indicates that they may also be one of the mainstream news sources in Kronos, which is why they are attractive to shadow writers. Some sources like All News Today (linked to Homeland Illumination), Central Bulletin (linked to The Abila Post), International News (linked to Kronos Star), Who What News (linked to The World), and World Source (linked to International Times) derive almost all their derivative articles from a single source. This indicates that there might be some links between the reporting staff at those agencies and the primary source news agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssessing the types of relationships by author (see Figure 3 below), we find that most of the authors exclusively use shadow authoring, with only Petrus’ articles being reprinted with his name in other sources. Note that there are many articles without author names.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne possible reason for this reluctance to explicitly declare their authorship could be that authors are deliberatly attempting to use a more reputable news source (e.g. News Online Today) to spread their message without compromising said news source by associating openly with it. Since 2005 (based on materials provided), the Protectors of Kronos (POK) have gotten increasingly militant and government crackdowns have similarly stepped up. Considering the political situation, we can compare the evolving dynamics of primary-derivative source relationships before 2005 and after 2005. From Figures 4a and 4b below, we can see that while shadow authoring relationships have always been prevalent, after 2005, no authors have published articles in other news sources under their own names any more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.2. QUESTION 2\r\nCharacterize any biases you identify in these news sources, with respect to their representation of specific people, places, and events. Give examples. Please limit your answer to 6 images and 500 words.\r\n4.2.1. Solution Approach and Data Wrangling\r\nVisualising bias will require more in depth analysis of the article texts. We will used frequency-based analysis to characterise the articles for bias detection. First, we need to identify entities which we wish to study, namely:\r\nProtectors of Kronos\r\nKronos Government\r\nGAStech\r\nWe will define some keywords to label our dataset accordingly. Articles will be indicated as making a representation about each of these entities if certain keywords are mentioned in the article.\r\n\r\n\r\n# define key words\r\nentities <- c(\"POK\", \"Govt\", \"GAStech\")\r\n\r\nkeywords1 <- c(\"Protectors of Kronos\", \"POK\",\r\n    \"Elian Karel\", \"Silvia Marek\", \"Mandor Vann\",\r\n    \"Isia Vann\", \"Lucio Jakab\", \"Lorenzo Di Stefano\")\r\nkeywords2 <- c(\"government\", \"ministry\",\r\n    \"minister\", \"president\", \"military\",\r\n    \"police\", \"mayor\")\r\nkeywords3 <- c(\"GAStech\")\r\n\r\nkeywords <- list(keywords1, keywords2, keywords3)\r\n\r\narticle_df[entities] <- NA\r\n\r\nfor (i in 1:nrow(article_df)) {\r\n    text <- str_to_lower(gsub(\"[[:punct:]]\",\r\n        \"\", article_df$text[i]))\r\n    for (j in 1:length(keywords)) {\r\n        for (k in 1:length(keywords[[j]])) {\r\n            if (str_detect(text, str_to_lower(keywords[[j]][k]))) {\r\n                article_df[i, 7 + j] <- TRUE\r\n            } else {\r\n                if (isNA(article_df[i, 7 +\r\n                  j])) {\r\n                  article_df[i, 7 + j] <- FALSE\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, we turn our attention to the sentiment analysis.\r\nFirst, we will convert our corpus of articles into a document-term matrix, using text frequency - inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) to fill in the values. TF-IDF is used because it supresses words that appear commonly across all documents through the inverse document frequency term. This eliminates the need to specify stopwords to remove from the corpus, which is tedious and might not be too accurate as some stopwords also depend on the unique characteristics of each corpus.\r\nWe will also lemmatize the words using the textstem package to better capture the meaning of each document by converting various forms of words to their root word (e.g. ‘running’, ‘ran’, and ‘run’ will be reduced to ‘run’). Another approach is stemming, where t he ends of words are truncated based on heuristics to remove derivational and inflectional affixes (e.g. -s, -ed, -es, -ing, -tion). Past research (di Nanzio, Vezzani, 2018) has shown that lemmatization and stemming are comparable in terms of performance. We will go with lemmatization for this project because the output are base words, which are more understandable.\r\nWe will also remove numerics so that we can avoid cluttering the document-term matrix and zoom in on word meanings to analyse sentiment.\r\n\r\n\r\ndtm <- article_df[, c(\"doc_id\", \"text\")] %>%\r\n    unnest_tokens(word, text)\r\n\r\n# lemmatize words\r\ndtm$word <- lemmatize_words(dtm$word)\r\n\r\n# establish word counts\r\ndtm <- dtm %>%\r\n    count(doc_id, word, sort = TRUE)\r\n\r\n# remove numerics\r\ndtm <- dtm[-which(grepl(\"^[[:digit:]]+\",\r\n    dtm$word)), ]\r\n\r\n# calculate tf-idf\r\ndtm <- dtm %>%\r\n    bind_tf_idf(word, doc_id, n)\r\n\r\n# cast dtm\r\ndtm <- dtm %>%\r\n    cast_dtm(doc_id, word, tf_idf)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe plot a wordcloud (see Figure 5 below) to compare the common words used when each of the three entities are mentioned in an article. From the word cloud, it can be seen that the words commonly used when talking about the government or GAStech are largely neutral, while those used in describing POK have more negative connotations (e.g. violence, vandalism, assault).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, we now need to characterise the individual words in order to capture sentiment, so that we can apply an analysis on each news source to identify bias. Our approach will be as follows:\r\nExtract and manually annotate the vocabulary to characterise words as follows:\r\nNegative to POK (e.g. terrorist, vandalism, riot, loot, criminal)\r\nPositive to POK (e.g. activist, protest, demonstration, peaceful)\r\nNegative to Government (e.g. favoritism, corruption, kleptocracy)\r\nPositive to Government (e.g. investment, development)\r\nNegative to GAStech (e.g. toxic, acidic, contamination)\r\n\r\nFor each set of entity mentions:\r\nSummarise the document-term matrix by news source, taking the column means to get the average sentiment of the articles produced by the news source mentioning said entity.\r\nMultiply the td-idf score for each word by the annotated word sentiment score (-1 for negative, 0 for neutral, 1 for positive).\r\nSum the sentiment scores for all words for each news source. That will be the sentiment score for the news source.\r\nNormalise the sentiment scores, by computing the z-statistic. This is to ensure that the relative favorability of a news source for each entity is comparable across entities\r\n\r\nVisualise the relative favorability of each news source with respect to each entity.\r\nWe use manual annotation of the vocabulary because our approach to detection entity mentions does not preclude the possibility that one article may mention multiple entities (e.g. talking about both the govt and POK or all three). If we were to use open source sentiment dictionaries, we would not be able to distinguish which entity the positive or negative sentiment is about. Thankfully, the words that are used to describe each entity are usually quite divergent. For example, corruption would not be used to describe POK (for which the divergent opinion will be between seeing them as a terrorist group or a just cause), but would most certainly be directed at the government or GAStech. In this way, we can craft a bespoke sentiment dictionary that allows us to extract sentiments unique to our particular use case.\r\n\r\n\r\n# extract vocabulary, only interested\r\n# in words with high tf-idf scores\r\nvocabulary <- c()\r\n\r\nfor (i in 1:ncol(dtm)) {\r\n    if (max(dtm[, i]) > 0.05) {\r\n        vocabulary <- c(vocabulary, colnames(dtm)[i])\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n# export vocabulary for manual\r\n# annotation\r\nwrite.csv(vocabulary, \"vocab.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter manual annotation, we will create a reference dictionary with the sentiment tagged to each word for data wrangling.\r\n\r\n\r\n# load in annotated vocabulary\r\nvocab_annotated <- read.csv(\"vocab_annotated.csv\")\r\n\r\n# remove old index\r\nvocab_annotated <- vocab_annotated[, 2:5]\r\n\r\n# convert NA to 0\r\nvocab_annotated[is.na(vocab_annotated)] <- 0\r\n\r\n# remove neutral words\r\nvocab_annotated <- vocab_annotated[which(row_sums(vocab_annotated[,\r\n    2:4]) != 0), ]\r\n\r\n# create a reference dictionary\r\nref_dict <- Terms(dtm)\r\n\r\n# populate the ref dictionary\r\nfor (i in 1:length(entities)) {\r\n    new_row <- rep(0, length(ref_dict))\r\n    if (i == 1) {\r\n        for (j in 1:nrow(vocab_annotated)) {\r\n            new_row[which(ref_dict == vocab_annotated[j,\r\n                1])] <- vocab_annotated[j,\r\n                i + 1]\r\n        }\r\n    } else {\r\n        for (j in 1:nrow(vocab_annotated)) {\r\n            new_row[which(colnames(ref_dict) ==\r\n                vocab_annotated[j, 1])] <- vocab_annotated[j,\r\n                i + 1]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    ref_dict <- rbind(ref_dict, new_row)\r\n    # set column names to be the terms\r\n    colnames(ref_dict) <- Terms(dtm)\r\n}\r\n\r\n# remove the first row\r\nref_dict <- ref_dict[-1, ]\r\n\r\n# set row names to be the entities\r\nrownames(ref_dict) <- entities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe then compute the sentiment scores for each news source with respect to each entity.\r\n\r\n\r\n# first create subset dtms for each\r\n# group of articles\r\ndtm_pk <- dtm[which(rownames(dtm) %in% article_df$doc_id[article_df$POK]),\r\n    ]\r\ndtm_gv <- dtm[which(rownames(dtm) %in% article_df$doc_id[article_df$Govt]),\r\n    ]\r\ndtm_ga <- dtm[which(rownames(dtm) %in% article_df$doc_id[article_df$GAStech]),\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n# define function to summarise the dtm\r\n# by news source (need to reference\r\n# from the article_df table)\r\nsummarise_bysrc <- function(dtm) {\r\n    for (i in 1:length(news_sources)) {\r\n        if (i == 1) {\r\n            dtm_bysrc <- col_means(dtm[which(rownames(dtm) %in%\r\n                article_df$doc_id[which(article_df$source ==\r\n                  news_sources[i])]), ])\r\n        } else {\r\n            dtm_bysrc <- rbind(dtm_bysrc,\r\n                col_means(dtm[which(rownames(dtm) %in%\r\n                  article_df$doc_id[which(article_df$source ==\r\n                    news_sources[i])]), ]))\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    # set the col and row names\r\n    colnames(dtm_bysrc) <- Terms(dtm)\r\n    rownames(dtm_bysrc) <- news_sources\r\n\r\n    return(dtm_bysrc)\r\n}\r\n\r\n# perform summaries by news source\r\ndtm_pk_bysrc <- summarise_bysrc(dtm_pk)\r\ndtm_gv_bysrc <- summarise_bysrc(dtm_gv)\r\ndtm_ga_bysrc <- summarise_bysrc(dtm_ga)\r\n\r\nsent_scores <- data_frame(news_source = news_sources,\r\n    POK = rep(0, length(news_sources)), Govt = rep(0,\r\n        length(news_sources)), GAStech = rep(0,\r\n        length(news_sources)))\r\n\r\n# define function to perform\r\n# element-wise multiplication with the\r\n# sentiment vocab\r\nget_sentiment <- function(dtm, ent, sent_scores) {\r\n    for (i in 1:nrow(dtm)) {\r\n        sent_scores[i, ent + 1] <- sum(dtm_pk_bysrc[i,\r\n            ] * as.numeric(ref_dict[ent,\r\n            ]))\r\n    }\r\n    return(sent_scores)\r\n}\r\n\r\n# perform element-wise multiplication\r\n# with the sentiment vocab\r\nsent_scores <- get_sentiment(dtm_pk_bysrc,\r\n    1, sent_scores)\r\nsent_scores <- get_sentiment(dtm_gv_bysrc,\r\n    2, sent_scores)\r\nsent_scores <- get_sentiment(dtm_ga_bysrc,\r\n    3, sent_scores)\r\n\r\n# normalise the sent_scores\r\nfor (i in 2:ncol(sent_scores)) {\r\n    mean <- mean(as.numeric(as.matrix(sent_scores)[,\r\n        i]))\r\n    sd <- sd(as.numeric(as.matrix(sent_scores)[,\r\n        i]))\r\n    for (j in 1:nrow(sent_scores)) {\r\n        sent_scores[j, i] <- (sent_scores[j,\r\n            i] - mean)/(sd)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n# pivot for plotting\r\nsent_scores <- pivot_longer(sent_scores,\r\n    cols = !news_source, names_to = \"entity\",\r\n    values_to = \"sent_score\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.2.2. Answer\r\nBased on the results in Figure 6 below, we find that most news sources are more neutral in stance (i.e. clustered around the centre of the sentiment ratings). In general there is greater variability in favorability for POK, while favorability ratings for the government tend to be clustered in a tighter band, indicating that most news sources tend to report objectively or slightly favorably on the government. This is perhaps to be expected, as the government is usually able to exert some influence over news media in a country.\r\nIt is noted that All News Today is an outlier. It is the most vehemently anti-government and anti-GAStech news source, while it is also the most pro-POK news source. This is not surprising, and All News Today could have links with the POK organisation and senior leadership. We also note from the analysis in 4.2.1. that All News Today derives alot of content from shadow authors (i.e. Petrus Gerhard and Maha Salo) in Homeland Illumination, which is also noted to be slightly negative towards the government and GAStech and slightly more positive towards POK. The shadow authors would be a good place to investigate for links between POK and the media.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo validate our findings, let’s perform a wordcloud of All News Today’s articles regarding each entity and see what kind of words they tend to use regarding each entity. From the word cloud, we can see that All News Today tends to report alot on corruption and kleptocracy when reporting on GAStech or the government, while it tends to portray POK as a grassroots organisation supported by the people. This validates our findings from the sentiment analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.3. QUESTION 3\r\nGiven the data sources provided, use visual analytics to identify potential official and unofficial relationships among GASTech, POK, the APA, and Government. Include both personal relationships and shared goals and objectives. Provide evidence for these relationships. Please limit your answer to 6 images and 400 words.\r\n4.3.1. Solution Approach and Data Wrangling\r\nWe will do a simple graph analysis to explore relationships between GAStech employees using the email headers coupled with some employee data.\r\nFirst, we will extract the email data for manual annotation.\r\n\r\n\r\nwrite.csv(email_header_proc, \"email_header_annotate.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe reload the annotated data back in.\r\n\r\n\r\nedge_list <- read.csv(\"email_header_annotate.csv\")\r\n\r\n# wrangling time\r\nedge_list$sent_date <- ymd(edge_list$sent_date)\r\nedge_list$weekday <- wday(edge_list$sent_date,\r\n    label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)\r\n\r\n# replace wrong email addresses\r\nedge_list$source <- str_replace(edge_list$source,\r\n    \"tethys\", \"kronos\")\r\nedge_list$target <- str_replace(edge_list$target,\r\n    \"tethys\", \"kronos\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we will create nodes from the employee data.\r\n\r\n\r\nnode_list <- employee_data[, c(1:3, 5:6,\r\n    12:15)]\r\n\r\n# need to add the 19- to make sure\r\n# lubridate doesn't read as 21st\r\n# century\r\nnode_list$BirthDate <- str_replace(node_list$BirthDate,\r\n    \"-([0-9]{2}$)\", \"/19\\\\1\")\r\n\r\n# convert to date\r\nnode_list$BirthDate <- dmy(node_list$BirthDate)\r\nnode_list$CurrentEmploymentStartDate <- dmy(node_list$CurrentEmploymentStartDate)\r\n\r\n# calculate age\r\nnode_list$age <- year(max(edge_list$sent_date)) -\r\n    year(node_list$BirthDate)\r\nnode_list$years_employed <- year(max(edge_list$sent_date)) -\r\n    year(node_list$CurrentEmploymentStartDate)\r\n\r\n# drop birth date and employee start\r\n# date\r\nnode_list <- node_list[, -c(3, 8)]\r\n\r\n# give an id number for graphing\r\nnode_list$id <- c(1:nrow(node_list))\r\n\r\n# rearrange the columns\r\nnode_list <- node_list[, c(10, 7, 1, 2, 8,\r\n    3, 4, 9, 5, 6)]\r\n\r\n# rename the columns\r\ncolnames(node_list) <- c(\"id\", \"email\", \"last_name\",\r\n    \"first_name\", \"age\", \"gender\", \"citizenship\",\r\n    \"years_employed\", \"department\", \"title\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will also prepare data to make alluvial plots.

Answer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith reference to Figure 8, we can see that most emails, whether work or non-work related are sent within a department. This indicates that employees tend to form social circles within their own departments, as is expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlotting a network graph to visualise the email relationships, we find very different relationships for the work-related (Figure 9) and non-work related (Figure 10) emails. For work related emails, the bulk of the emails are confined within the department. There are a few individuals who are at the centre of the network who send the most work emails across the organisation, namely the assistant to the CEO, and the assistant to the Engineering Group Manager.\r\n\r\n\r\n{\"x\":{\"nodes\":{\"id\":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54],\"email\":[\"Mat.Bramar@gastech.com.kronos\",\"Anda.Ribera@gastech.com.kronos\",\"Rachel.Pantanal@gastech.com.kronos\",\"Linda.Lagos@gastech.com.kronos\",\"Ruscella.Mies.Haber@gastech.com.kronos\",\"Carla.Forluniau@gastech.com.kronos\",\"Cornelia.Lais@gastech.com.kronos\",\"Marin.Onda@gastech.com.kronos\",\"Isande.Borrasca@gastech.com.kronos\",\"Axel.Calzas@gastech.com.kronos\",\"Kare.Orilla@gastech.com.kronos\",\"Elsa.Orilla@gastech.com.kronos\",\"Brand.Tempestad@gastech.com.kronos\",\"Lars.Azada@gastech.com.kronos\",\"Felix.Balas@gastech.com.kronos\",\"Lidelse.Dedos@gastech.com.kronos\",\"Birgitta.Frente@gastech.com.kronos\",\"Adra.Nubarron@gastech.com.kronos\",\"Gustav.Cazar@gastech.com.kronos\",\"Vira.Frente@gastech.com.kronos\",\"Willem.Vasco-Pais@gastech.com.kronos\",\"Sten.Sanjorge

Step-by-step guide on preparing data visualisation in Tableau\r\n3.1 Data preparation in Excel\r\n3.2 Visualisation in Tableau\r\n\r\n4. New Visualisation and Observations\r\n\r\n1. Critique of the visualisation\r\n\r\nFig 1. Original data visualisation\r\n1.1 Clarity\r\nThe intent of the visualisation is to describe some of Singapore’s most important mechandise trade relationships. It shows which countries are net exporters to Singapore and which are net importers, and also informs the reader of the\r\nColor coding used for two dimensions - export vs import, and country/region. This makes it confusing for the reader as there is too much color in the visualisation. In order to direct the readers attention appropriately, one visualisation detail (e.g. size, colour, axes) should be used for one data dimension only.\r\n\r\nFig 2. Size does not scale linearly with total merchandise trade volume\r\nThe scaling of the bubble size is not based on area (see Fig 2 above). Instead, it is the radius which is proportional to the total bilateral trade volume. This makes the size scale polynomially (i.e. the square of the total bilateral trade volume)instead of linearly which can give rise to misinterpretation as the reader usually assumes that the size will scale linearly.\r\nThe bubbles are opaque, obscuring the data points showing the export/import amounts of some countries. This makes it difficult to see exactly how much Singapore imports/exports to these countries. The data labels only quote the total bilateral merchandise trade volume, from which the reader cannot derive the import/export figures.\r\nThe axes labels at clustered around the origin rather than centred on the axes. This makes it difficult for the reader to tell at a glance which axis refers to exports and which to imports. The visualisation attempts to use colours to differentiate the axes, but it is not as effective as using title positioning.\r\n\r\nFig 3. Annotation from original viz\r\nThe graphic does not help to convey to the reader the key message annotated in the blue box (see Fig 3 above). The key message in the blue box discusses Singapore’s overall balance of trade with the two largest economies in the world, Mainland China and the United States. It references trade data going back to 2006. However, the data in the visualisation only shows data for 2020.\r\nThe annotation does note use similar time scales in comparing the two countries. It compares trade with China dating back to 2009, but for the United States it uses trade data going back to 2006.\r\nThe visualisation designates a top net exporter and top net importer but does not explain what this means to the reader. It appears from inspection that this refers to the country with which Singapore has the highest and lowest balance of trade.\r\n1.2 Aesthetics\r\nBesides clarity the aesthetics of the visualisation could also be improved. Some observed weaknesses are:\r\nUse of large labels within opaque boxes creates a very cluttered impression. There is too much going on on the visualisation, with many boxes and icons scattered across the visualisation with very little explanatory value. For example, the data labels would be better served being inside the respective circles rather than sticking out from the circles to keep the rest of the graph clean.\r\n\r\nFig 4. Unnecessary icons\r\nUnnecessary use of large icons clutters visualisation with non-data ink.  The icons (e.g. ‘Imports’/‘Exports’ and ‘Top Importer’/‘Top Exporter’) are unnecessary. For the ‘Imports’/‘Exports’ axes labels, the text would have been sufficient.\r\nThere is too much colour in the visualisation. Even the background is blue even though color coding is a key detail used to convey information in this visualisation. The clash of colours is very irritating to the reader as it takes attention away from the key points the visualisation is trying to make.\r\n2. Proposed alternative visualisation\r\nThe proposed visualisation will address the issues raised above.\r\nAn interactive side-by-side comparison of trade data from selected years will help readers to compare change in trade data over time. This will help users to draw conclusions on any change in the nature of our trade relationships (e.g. change from net exporter to net importer or vice versa) as well as the relative importance of our various trade relationships when compared with one another.\r\nColor coding on the bubble chart will only be used for countries. This will help to direct the users attention appropriately to changes in our relationships with various countries/regions relative to each other.\r\nAxes are labeled in the middle of the axis for clarity.\r\nBubble size scales linearly, with the area corresponding to the relative volume of bilateral trade with respective country.\r\nReduce opacity of bubble fills so that all data points can be clearly visible.\r\nTotal Bilateral Trade is plotted separately as a supplementary chart. This will allow the reader to quickly see how our trade relationships are ranked year to year and identify trends (e.g. are some countries/regions becoming more/less important over time).\r\nBalance of trade is plotted separately as a supplementary chart. This does away with the need to identify ‘Top net exporter’ or ‘Top net importer’ with icons as the balance of trade plot will show the relative ranking of the various countries over time. We can also see trends in our trade relationships over time (E.g. some relationships evolving from net exporter to net importer and vice versa).\r\nLink all charts so that when a country is selected, it will be highlighted across all charts for attention. This will allow the reader to zoom into the relevant country and make comparisons.\r\nCustom tooltips to highlight key information more clearly.\r\n\r\nSketch of proposed data visualisation\r\n3. Step-by-step guide on preparing data visualisation in Tableau\r\n3.1 Data preparation in Excel\r\nAs the dataset used is the same as Data Viz Makeover 1, we follow the same steps noted in Data Viz Makeover 1 to prepare the data.\r\n3.2 Visualisation in Tableau\r\nOnce the data has been prepared, we now move to Tableau to execute the proposed visualisation.\r\nStep\r\nActions Required\r\nScreenshot\r\n1\r\nFirst, load the processed data into Tableau and join the Import and Export tables. We should use a full outer join as there will be cases where a country has registered exports but no registered imports for the given time period and vice versa. Any other form of join (e.g. left outer, right outer, inner) will result in loss of data. The data should be joined on Country/Region and Date\r\n\r\n2\r\nNext, create calculated fields to consolidate the data for Country/Region and Date as these fields will be nil for some rows if we only look at Imports or Exports. We can do this using an IFNULL statement.\r\n\r\n3\r\nNow create a calculated field for the total bilateral trade (i.e. exports + imports) and balance of trade (i.e. exports - imports). Be sure to use IFNULL to convert nulls to zeroes as null + value will return a null. This will cause the later visualisation to be wrong as data will be missed.\r\n\r\n4\r\nNow to begin creating the bubble charts. First, drag the import and export measures from the Data pane on the left to row and column respectively.\r\n\r\n5\r\nThen, select ‘circle’ under Marks. To color code the chart by country/region, drag the Country/Region dimension to the Color button under Marks. Then click on the Color button and set the opacity to ~50% and the border to white. To make the bubble size proportional to total bilateral trade volume, drag Total Bilateral Trade calculated measure to Size button under Marks.\r\n\r\n6\r\nWe now want to filter the chart to only see the ten countries/regions identified in the original visualisation. Drag the Country/Region and to the Filters tab and select the ten countries/regions.\r\n\r\n7\r\nWe want to create a toggle to allow the user to select the year for which we will display the data. However, we want to limit the user’s options to just the years between 2011 to 2020. To do so, we will need to create a copy of the Date dimension. Then drag the Date (copy) dimension to the Filters tab, select “Year” when prompted, and then select all the years between 2011 and 2020. Then drag Date to the Filters tab, select “Year” when prompted, and then select “2011”. Once the filter has been established, right-click the filter and select “Show Filter”. You should see the filter selector appear on the right.\r\n\r\n8\r\nAdjust the filter toggle’s settings to get the desired output. Click the top-right corner of the filter toggle and select “Single Value (list)” option and the “Only Relevant Values” option. Then navigate to “Customise” and uncheck the “Show ‘All’ Value” option.\r\n\r\n9\r\nNow we want to create the centroid of each bubble to that users can easily compare the respective import/export positions of the different countries. To do this we will use Dual Axes to plot the same Export vs Import data on top of the bubble chart. Drag the Export measure to the top edge of the chart till you see a dotted line appear. Do the same with the Import measure on the right edge of the chart.\r\n\r\n10\r\nSelect ‘Circle’ as the mark type, and select white as the color. Adjust the size of the centroid by clicking the Size button on the Marks tab and making the adjustment using the slider. We will also use this mark to label the bubbles, so drag Country/Region and Total Bilateral Trade to the Label button in the Marks tab. Change the number format of Total Bilateral Trade so that it displays in billions and one decimal place. Remove the secondary axes by right-clicking and unchecking “Show Header”.\r\n\r\n11\r\nWe now want to standardise the axes to ensure that the left and right bubble charts are always directly comparable. Right-click the Import axis and select “Edit Axis”. Set the Range to “Fixed” and fix the range between 0 and 80B. Also edit the axis title to include the units. Repeat with the Export axis.\r\n\r\n12\r\nWe want each bubble chart to be labelled with the selected year so that users can see which two years they are comparing. To do this, double click the sheet title on the top of the sheet and change the text to a variable, \"<Year(Date)>. The title of the bubble chart will now display the selected year.\r\n\r\n13\r\nIn order to give the user an idea of how the relationship changes over time, we will introduce animations that will kick in whenever the user toggles the year for the bubble chart. The movement will highlight to the user the relative changes in the trade relationship of respective countries. Select Format from the ribbon and click on Animations. Then on the Animations pane, select “On” and set the duration to “Medium”.\r\n\r\n14\r\nNow we will create the custom tooltip so that the user can get an informative analysis when he mouses over the respective bubble.  To create the reactive color coding and “+/-” prefix for the balance of trade, we will need to create two calculated fields, one field, bot_neg will be null when the balance of trade is positive, and the other field, bot_pos will be null when the balance of trade is negative. Use an IF statement to do this. Next, we also want to have reactive text highlighting whether Singapore is a net importer from or exporter to the respective country. We do this similarly with IF statement to create two more calculated variables, net_imp-exp and to_from. We separate out the “to/from” so that we can highlight the “net importer”/“net exporter” with an increased font size. Once done, drag all the new calculated fields into the Tooltip button on the Marks tab. Now drag the Date into the Tooltip button as well. Date is trickier because there are multiple dates to be aggregated as the date in the data is given by month. To resolve this issue, we select “Maximum” under Measure and adjust the format of the date to show only the year. Finally put it all together by clicking the Tooltip button and typing the text out as shown.\r\n\r\n15\r\nHurray! You are now done with the bubble chart. Name this sheet “Left” and duplicate the sheet by right-clicking the sheet tab at the bottom and clicking duplicate. Name this sheet “Right”\r\n\r\n16\r\nWe now create the line graphs to show the total bilateral trade and balance of trade over time. To do so, create a new sheet and drag Total Bilateral Trade to rows and Date to columns. Select “Year” to aggreagate the measure by year. Filter by Country/Region and Date so that we only see the ten countries we are studying and the data is shown for 2011 to 2020. Color code by country region and add in a country/region label (see similar steps above if unsure). Name this sheet “Bilat Trade”. Create an informative tooltip.\r\n\r\n17\r\nCreate another new sheet. Drag Balance of Trade to rows and Date to columns. Select “Year” to aggreagate the measure by year. Filter by Country/Region and Date so that we only see the ten countries we are studying and the data is shown for 2011 to 2020. Color code by country region and add in a country/region label (see similar steps above if unsure). Name this sheet “BoT” for Balance of Trade.\r\n\r\n18\r\nWe want to create some additional annotations on the BoT chart to highlight to users when a country is a net importer or exporter. First create a reference line by right-clicking the vertical axis and clicking “Add Reference Line”. Format the reference line so that it stands out. Label this line “Breakeven point” and fill the area below the line grey. Format the reference line label by clicking on the reference line and selecting format. Adjust the text to make it prominent and set the shading opacity. Right-click anywhere on the chart and create an area annotation. Do one for “Net Exporter” and one for “Net Importer”. Adjust the font colors and positioning to make clear which area of the graph the annotation is referring to.\r\n\r\n19\r\nCreate an informative tooltip (see similar steps above if unsure).\r\n\r\n20\r\nNow put everything together by creating a new dashboard. Drag and drop the various sheets onto the dashboard and position accordingly. We will use floating text tiles to show that the two bubble charts are meant to be compared by putting a “vs” in the middle. We will also use the floating text tile to create an annotation that the bubble sizes are based on total bilateral trade volume. Create a floating text tile by selecting “Floating” under the Dashboard pane and dragging a text tile from “Objects” onto the dashboard.\r\n\r\nAnd now you’re done!\r\n4. New Visualisation and Observations\r\nExecuting the visualisation described in Section 2, we produce the following graphic. The workbook can also be accessed on Tableau Public here.\r\n\r\nExample of New data visualisation\r\nEmbedded Interactive Visualisation\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1624200890209');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='1577px';}                     var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                \r\nFrom the visualisation, we can make the following observations:\r\nSince 2011, our trade with China and the United States has grown most strongly, with China surpassing Malaysia as our main trading partner in 2013. The increase in merchandise trade volume with the United States has been driven by strong export growth, which has caused the relationship to evolve from a net importer to net exporter in 2020. With China, growth is more even between both imports and exports and our balance of trade has been largely hovering between +1.0B to +13.0B.\r\nOur trading relationship with Malaysia has been steadily changing over time, from a net exporter with +14.9B balance of trade in 2011 to a net importer with -11.6B balance of trade in 2020. This could be due to a shift in our economy to focus more on high-tech manufacturing and services which have less demand in Malaysia, while we continue to purchase large quantities of food and other commodities from Malaysia.\r\nOur well diversified portfolio of trading relationships allows us to maintain a health balance of trade. Even though relationships with individual countries have been changing significantly over time due to trends in the global economy as well as Singapore’s efforts to transform our economy to remain relevant in the future, we are still able to maintain a healthy current account balance as we balance lost export revenue from some countries with increased export revenue to other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Proposed alternative visualisation\r\n2.1 Proposed narrative\r\n2.2 Sketch of alternative visualisation\r\n\r\n3. Step-by-step guide on preparing data visualisation in Tableau\r\n3.1 Data preparation in Excel\r\n3.2 Visualisation in Tableau\r\n\r\n4. New Visualisation and Observations\r\n\r\n1. Critique of the visualisation\r\n\r\nOriginal data visualisation\r\n1.1 Clarity\r\nThe intent of the visualisation is to describe Singapore’s top six merchandise trade relationships between 2019 and 2020. However, it is difficult to discern a clear narrative from the visualisation because:\r\nThe axes ranges are not standardised across each graph in the grid. This makes it difficult to compare the trends and figures from each country with each other as each are on different scales.\r\nOn each grid, the primary (export) and secondary (import) axes ranges are not standardised. This makes it difficult to compare the relative proportion of import to exports for each trading partner. This proportion informs the reader whether the Singapore has a trade deficit or surplus with the respective trading partner. This detail is one of the key statistics used in defining a trading relationship.\r\nThe time scales are not standardised across the different trading partners. Japan only has data for 2020, while all the others show data from 2019 to 2021.\r\nThe time scales also do not match the title, which says “Merchandise Trade of Top Six Trading Countries, 2019-2020” even though 5 of the 6 grids show data going all the way to 2021, and the remaining grid (Japan) only shows data from 2020.\r\nIt is not be meaningful to visualise the data as a time series as the data shows little variation between 2019 and 2020, as would be expected as trade relationships rarely change significantly over a period of one to two years.\r\n1.2 Aesthetics\r\nBesides clarity the aesthetics of the visualisation could also be improved. Some observed weaknesses are:\r\nUse of area graphs clutters the visualisation with unnecessary data ink. The fill is not meaningful as it does not help to highlight anything from the data. Simple line graphs could easily communicate the same message with less clutter.\r\nUse of individual axes for each graph clutters the visualisation with alot of non-data ink.  Standardising the axes would not only fix clarity issues (mentioned in Section 1.1), but also allow the removal of the axes from some of the grids to reduce non-data ink which distracts from the actual visualisation.\r\nGrid is too small making it difficult to make out details in the data. Visualising the data individually for each country results in a very cramped grid which is difficult to read as each graph is too small.\r\nWasted white space below the color legend. The space in the visualisation is not utilised well. With the main visualisation already cramped, the space under the legend could have been better utilised by data ink.\r\n2. Proposed alternative visualisation\r\n2.1 Proposed narrative\r\nThe visualisation should inform the reader about Singapore’s merchandise trade based on the trading volume data. The user should be able to draw some key insights such as:\r\nWho are Singapore’s biggest trading partners?\r\nIs Singapore too dependent on a handful of countries?\r\nDoes Singapore import more than we export?\r\nThis narrative will help to give the reader an idea of Singapore’s merchandise trade dependecies.\r\n2.2 Sketch of alternative visualisation\r\nBased on the above narrative, it is proposed that the data be visualised as a “pyramid” chart, where:\r\nExport and Import volumes are visualised side by side on inverted axes. This will allow a reader to immediately see the total bilateral trade volume for a given country/region. It also informs the reader of the nature of the trading relationship with that country/region (e.g. surplus or deficit).\r\nThe data is sorted in descending order of total bilateral trade volume. This will allow the reader to immediately see which are our most important trading partners.\r\nData should be truncated to the top N trading relationships so that the visualisation does not get too cluttered. N should be a nice round number (e.g. 10, 20) to make for easy reading.\r\nAxes should be removed to reduce non-data ink. They are unnecessary anyway, as the relative differences in the trading volumes are well captured by the length of the bars. We can also add data labels for easy reading.\r\nImports are put on the left as people tend to associate the rightward direction with outgoing and the leftward direction with incoming. This helps to make the visualisation more intuitive.\r\nUse the same colors, but different shades, for imports and exports. This helps to reduce the number of different colours on the page and helps the reader to focus on the length of the bars which is the main focus of the visualisation.\r\nAdditional visualisation at the bottom shows how big a share of our merchandise trading volumes is dependent on the top N countries. This will help to give the reader a sense of our dependence on these relationships.\r\n\r\nSketch of proposed data visualisation\r\n3. Step-by-step guide on preparing data visualisation in Tableau\r\n3.1 Data preparation in Excel\r\nIn order to use the data in Tableau to generate the desired visualisation, we would first have to “unstack” the table and ensure that the date is stored as a dimension, rather than be used as a column name. This will allow Tableau to process the data as a time series.\r\n\r\nData transformation required\r\nThis data transformation can be done using Excel VBA. Be sure to pay attention to the data, as there might be some inconsistency that will impact the transformation. For example, “na” is usually used to denote missing data. However, from Jan 1998 to Dec 1998, trade data for imports from ‘Yemen Democratic’ was indicated by ‘-’. The macro below includes code breaks to help pick out such issues. In this case, simple replace all ‘-’ with ‘na’.\r\nYou may refer here for details on how to use VBA on Microsoft Excel. The site will show you how to access the script editor. I’ve also provided the script I used to process the data below. This script can be copied into the script editor and run to transform the data into the desired form.\r\nExample VBA script to perform data transformation:\r\n\r\n#VBA code to execute data processing\r\n\r\nSub unstack_table()\r\n\r\nDim data_range As Range\r\nDim data As String\r\n\r\nIf ActiveSheet.Name = \"T1\" Then\r\n    data = \"Imports\"\r\nElseIf ActiveSheet.Name = \"T2\" Then\r\n    data = \"Exports\"\r\nElse\r\n    GoTo err_break1\r\nEnd If\r\n\r\nSet data_range = Range(\"B8\", Range(\"B8\").End(xlDown).End(xlToRight))\r\n\r\nFor i = 1 To data_range.Rows.Count\r\n    For j = 1 To data_range.Columns.Count\r\n        If data_range.Cells(i, j) <> \"na\" Then\r\n            Sheets(data).Cells(1, 1).End(xlDown).Offset(1).Value = _\r\n              Trim(Split(data_range.Cells(i, 1).Offset(, -1).Text, \"(\")(0))\r\n            Sheets(data).Cells(1, 2).End(xlDown).Offset(1).Value = _\r\n              Split(data_range.Cells(1, j).Offset(-2).Text, \" \")(1) & \" \" & _\r\n              Split(data_range.Cells(1, j).Offset(-2).Text, \" \")(0)\r\n            If Split(data_range.Cells(i, 1).Offset(, -1).Text, \"(\")(1) = _\r\n              \"Thousand Dollars)\" Then\r\n                Sheets(data).Cells(1, 3).End(xlDown).Offset(1).Value = _\r\n                  data_range.Cells(i, j).Value * 1000\r\n            ElseIf Split(data_range.Cells(i, 1).Offset(, -1).Text, \"(\")(1) = _\r\n              \"Million Dollars)\" Then\r\n                Sheets(data).Cells(1, 3).End(xlDown).Offset(1).Value = _\r\n                data_range.Cells(i, j).Value * 1000000\r\n            Else\r\n                GoTo err_break2\r\n            End If\r\n        End If\r\n    Next j\r\nNext i\r\n\r\nGoTo endsub\r\n\r\nerr_break1:\r\n\r\nMsgBox \"Select either sheet T1 or T2 to run the macro\"\r\n\r\nGoTo endsub\r\n\r\nerr_break2:\r\n\r\nMsgBox \"Something is wrong with \" & data_range.Cells(i, 1).Offset(, -1).Text\r\n\r\nendsub:\r\n\r\nEnd Sub\r\n\r\nPerform this transformation on both the Import and Export data to generate two separate tables. Note that in the event of ‘na’, the data is not copied over, which will result in ‘null’ returns when the data is visualised in Tableau. This should be the correct interpretation for the missing data at this point, as we cannot assume that missing data means that there was no trade at all (which is indicated by a zero in the data).\r\n3.2 Visualisation in Tableau\r\nOnce the data has been prepared, we now move to Tableau to execute the proposed visualisation.\r\nStep\r\nActions Required\r\nScreenshot\r\n1\r\nFirst, load the processed data into Tableau and join the Import and Export tables. We should use a full outer join as there will be cases where a country has registered exports but no registered imports for the given time period and vice versa. Any other form of join (e.g. left outer, right outer, inner) will result in loss of data. The data should be joined on Country/Region and Date\r\n\r\n2\r\nNext, create calculated fields to consolidate the data for Country/Region and Date as these fields will be nil for some rows if we only look at Imports or Exports. We can do this using an IFNULL statement.\r\n\r\n3\r\nNow create a calculated field for the total bilateral trade (i.e. exports + imports). We will be using this value to rank the countries/regions later. Be sure to use IFNULL to convert nulls to zeroes as null + value will return a null. This will cause the later visualisation to be wrong as data will be missed.\r\n\r\n4\r\nCreate the centrepiece of the data visualisation, the ‘pyramid’ bar chart. We do this by dragging Imports and Exports into the columns and setting the visualisation to bar. Change the color of the Exports bars to differentiate them from the Imports bars by selecting Color on the Marks tab and editing the color for the Exports bar graph. Then we drag Country/Region into the rows so that the data is split by country/region. To achieve row banding for better visualisation, right-click Country/Region and select Format. Then select the Shading tab (i.e. the third tab) and choose a colour for Pane under Row Banding. Set the Banding Size to the second notch. Finally, we use the filters to filter the data by date to 2019-2020 which is the time range specified in the original visualisation.\r\n\r\n5\r\nRight-click the horizontal axis of Imports, which should be on the left side of the graph and reverse the axis so that the origin starts from the right instead of the left. This will create the “pyramid” look\r\n\r\n6\r\nWhile on the edit axis menu, select Tick Marks and set both major and minor tick marks to None. We don’t want to clutter out visualisation with non-data ink! Repeat this with the Export axis and then hide both axes by right-clicking and deselecting the Show Header option.\r\n\r\n7\r\nAdd data labels by dragging Imports and Exports to the respective Marks tab. Format the number by clicking on the right side of the green pill bar and selecting Format. Then select Pane and edit the number format in Number. We want to visualise the number in ‘billions’ to reduce the length of the numbers and reduce clutter in our visualisation.\r\n\r\n8\r\nRight-click the Country/Region headers on the left and click Format. Then adjust the fonts and size in the Header tab.\r\n\r\n9\r\nNow right-click the Country/Region pill bar under Rows and select Sort. We will now sort the data in the bar graphs by total bilateral trade volumes to identify our most important merchandise trade relationships.\r\n\r\n10\r\nNotice that interspersed among our biggest trade relationships are regions which are actually whole continents (e.g. Asia, America). These are aggregated data from the countries that belong in the respective continent or region (e.g. European Union). We will have to remove this data from the visualisation to avoid double counting. Drag the Country/Region dimension into the Filters tab and then right-click and Edit Filter. Uncheck the continents and regions.\r\n\r\n11\r\nNow we can see all out trading relationships between 2019-2020. We shall pick the top 20 relationships for the visualisation. Right-click the Country/Region filter and select the Top tab. Then select By field and specify the top 20 in Total Bilateral Trade. You are now done with the centrepiece graph!\r\n\r\n12\r\nTo create the bars showing the proportion of total trading volume contributed by the top 20 countries/regions, we will need to do so on a new worksheet. Create a new sheet by selecting the New Worksheet button at the the bottom.\r\n\r\n13\r\nDrag Imports to columns and select Bar as the type of mark. Perform the necessary filtering as described in Steps 4 and 10. In order to reuse this for the Exports chart, right-click the Country/Regions filter and click Create Set. You can call this set “Less Regions Set”\r\n\r\n14\r\nCreate a another set by right-clicking Country/Region under the Data tab on the left of the screen. Then select Create and Set. In this set, select the top 20 countries as identified from the visualisation generated in Steps 1 to 11.\r\n\r\n15\r\nNow drag this new set into the Marks tab and set it to color. Then click the Color button on the Marks tab and click Edit Colors…. Choose the colors for the IN and OUT. This specifies the colors for data within the top 20 countries set and outside the top 20 countries set. We will make them blue and gray for maximum contrast as shade is already used to distinguish between exports and imports.\r\n\r\n16\r\nWe will need the data labels to be informative as we want to reduce clutter and non-data ink. Therefore, we will need to create a calculated field that will label the top 20 countries data with “Top 20:” and not label anything on the data outside the set.\r\n\r\n17\r\nThen use Quick Table Calculation to create the Percent of Total to add to the data label.\r\n\r\n18\r\nPut it all together by using the Edit Label function in the Marks tab as shown.\r\n\r\n19\r\nRepeat this for Exports.\r\n\r\n20\r\nFinally, it is time to put everything together into our final visualisation. We will use a dashboard to do this, so create a dashboard by clicking the respective button at the bottom.\r\n\r\n21\r\nDrag the sheets onto the page and arrange them in a neat order. Use the Blank objects for spacers as needed and the Text objects to input text into your visualisations.\r\n\r\n22\r\nUse the Layout tab to provide background color for your text objects as needed.\r\n\r\nAnd now you’re done!\r\n4. New Visualisation and Observations\r\nExecuting the visualisation described in Section 2, we produce the following graphic. The workbook can also be accessed on Tableau Public here.\r\n\r\nNew data visualisation\r\nFrom the visualisation, we can make the following observations:\r\nIt becomes immediately apparent that the original visualisation was incorrect in identifying Singapore’s top 6 merchandise trade relationships. It should be Indonesia and not Japan which is included in the top 6.\r\nWe have a diverse and global set of trading partners, with four continents represented amongst our top 20 merchandise trading relationships.\r\nOur top 5 trade relationships account for nearly half of our merchandise trade by volume, and our top 20 account for about 90% of our merchandise trade. This shows that while we are fairly well diversified geographically speaking, Singapore is still quite dependent on a handful of major trading partners.\r\nWe are a net exporter. We export about 10% more merchandise (by value) than we import, which indicates that we run a trade surplus with regards to merchandise. Some of our trade relationships feature a significant trade imbalance (e.g. trade with Hong kong runs a signficant surplus, while trade with Taiwan runs a significant deficit). This information, along with information types of merchandise exported, services trade data, etc. are important to inform our exchange rate policy, which has significant impacts on our trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
