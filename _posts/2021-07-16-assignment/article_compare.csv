Two years ago yesterday Elian Karel died at age 28 in an Abila jail cell, purportedly of cardiac arrest.  Kraft had reached an agreement with the government that charges would be reduced and the Karel be released pending a trial, but Karel died two days before he was to go free. 
Questions linger, however, about the manner of Karel's death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police,  whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death, would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation.  After Karel's body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel's death stating that ""we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries.""
As reported at the time of Karel's death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel's body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police. 
Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karel's death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence. 
Yesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water.   
""Both of them died because of government lies and corruption,"" one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.  ""Juliana died because Kronos allowed GAStech to poison our water, and Elian died because he tried to bring Juliana justice.""

Danisliau confirmed that the second plane's destination was Rome, Italy.
Between the two private jets that departed the Abila Airport fourteen to sixteen people could have been passengers. This could easily account for the leadership of GAStech - Kronos.

The Emergency Department at Abila General Hospital in Kronos has been swamped in the last month by people suffering medical complications from designer drugs such as ""cotton candy"" and synthetic marijuana, a hospital official said.
""We have had at least two dozen cases in the last month,"" said Alicia Bianca, nurse manager of the department. ""We are literally overwhelmed.""
Bianca said she has never seen this level of activity related to drug overdoses in the seven years she has managed the Emergency Department and in the 20 years she has been a nurse.
Authorities in Abila said ""cotton candy"" may have been a factor in the death of 54-year-old Ralf Potter, whose bruised and naked body was found February 4 along a dead-end road. Investigators are awaiting toxicology reports to determine the cause of his death. Citywide, several deaths have been attributed to ""Cotton Candy"" according to the Kronos National Poison Center.
Patients are coming to Abila General from throughout the greater city region, and they include adults and youths, male and female, and all socio-economic backgrounds, Bianca said.
Sgt Antonio Arresta of the Abila Fire Department, a first-responder to emergency medical calls in the city, said his department has also seen a spike in the number of people needing treatment for complications from designer drugs. ""We went from zero calls to a handful of calls"" in the last month,"" he said.
Bianca and Arresta said their efforts to treat people is made more difficult because they often do not know anything about the designer drugs that were taken.
""You don't know what you're getting when you get it,"" Bianca said. ""We have had patients come in and act out of control, who are very violent. They tell us they have been doing cotton candy or synthetic marijuana.""
Bianca said there is little clinical data on the effects of cotton candy, as it is an emerging toxicant. ""There are no controlled studies in toxicology,"" she said. The national poison center collects anecdotal reports on overdoses from hospitals and other providers as part of efforts to offer advice on how to treat patients.
Designer drugs are chemical compounds synthesized to resemble the active ingredient in often illegal drugs. Cotton candy mimics the drug khat, a stimulant. Manufacturers frequently change the designer drug's chemical composition and its name to stay one step ahead of authorities, Biance said. ""It is another way to sell it,"" she said.
The term cotton candy, for example, is a nickname of the drug and has nothing to do with the carnival treat. The drug has been sold under the name of ""Spice Dreams"" one week and under the name of ""Tulip Blossom"" the next. 
The Kronos government has placed three of the chemicals commonly used in the creation of cotton candy on its controlled substance list, criminalizing their use and possession. Still, the government cannot outright ban cotton candy because manufacturers can alter the recipe and skirt the law, Bianca said. The drugs are sold online as ""herbal therapy"" products and are available over the counter in area stores.
""We still don't know what you are getting with cotton candy. The chemical composition varies from package to package,"" Bianca said.
One factor for the popularity of cotton candy is its low cost, Bianca said. She said a gram of cotton candy costs about K18 while a gram of cocaine costs K166.
Cotton candy creates euphoria, or a high, that is equal to or greater than that of cocaine but also causes a crash that is worse, Bianca said. The crash's ill-effects often prompt people to binge on cotton candy to the point where they consume the drug for days. ""They crave it,"" she said.
After repeated use, the drug ""fries"" a person's brain, draining the chemicals that balance its operations. This sometimes leads to bizarre, often psychotic behavior that has been reported in the media, such as the case of the naked man in Elodis who was found running down the middle of a major highway, Bianca said. ""The seizures and delusions are incredible,"" she said.
While it is not yet certain who is behind the distribution of this round of designer drugs, police suspect organized crime is pursuing this large income source. The Asterian People's Army has traditionally been involved with drug trafficking throughout the region, and enforcement agencies are closely examining possible cooperation between drug trafficking organizations and political insurgent groups.

Traffic snarled around the city as Abilians struggle to get to work amid vandalism and looting
Early on Tuesday police stormed the front of the presidential mansion and the capital building, breaking up a sit in by the Protectors of Kronos.
Other activist groups have joined the protesting faction in solidarity and a bigger rally was predicted for later in the day.
The conservative Kronos government used an emergency law to threaten the protestors with arrest unless they dispersed and returned to work.  The row is over environmental issues the POK holds the government and the gas giant GAStech international responsible.
The rallies had begun peacefully, however more destructive activities have escalated as the crowds became more restless. 
Signs among the protester called for government change and social equality.  Images of Juliana Vann, the 10 year old girl who died from illnesses attributed to the industrial giant GAStech international served as rallying points.
People heading to a pro-government counter-rally were attacked by POK supporters, and later shots were fired.  
Tuesday was the third anniversary of the mysterious death of Elian Karel, a popular leader of the POK who died in prison. 
Later in the day, what had been a largely peaceful demonstration turned violent when the crowd started vandalizing government buildings and the presidential homestead.  
A group of younger protestors attacked vehicles, smashing windows.  Minor injuries were reported. 
Police reinforcements were sent to the area and blocked roads, and skirmishes between the police and protestors broke out. 
Police used tear gas to break up the unruly crowd.  Government spokesmen complemented the security forces for their handling of the ""gangs of criminals"" disrupting the peace.

 AUTHOR:   
 PUBLISHED:  19-02-1982 
 LOCATION:   
 
 
The world of gas is distant, difficult and far flung. In Tethys a few years ago, I journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of Tethys to look at a contentious new energy producing area.
One of the sites I visited was a local office of the Sanjorge Gas company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation. As I remember it, a former trucker was in charge.
It was a vivid example of how a once small exploration company from Thethys had begun to grow into a mighty international force in the energy industry.
But I'd forgotten about the encounter until I went back to Tethys the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: one man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it.
But as I went round the capital city of Centrum interviewing people, I soon realised that this was not just a story of new energy. Something very significant has happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas industry expertise. From what's developed in the capital city there are important lessons for other places blessed (and cursed) with abundant natural resources.
""Centrum developed world class expertise in engineering in very difficult surroundings""
When I was a young newspaperman on the Daily Record in Glasgow in the early 1970s, the great off-shore oil rush was beginning in the North Sea. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, turning an island of coal into a place with abundant oil and gas supplies.
It seemed to us on the west coast of Scotland that the far flung city of Centrum, Tethys was getting a bit big for its boots, starting to believe in a new fantasy industry.
Much to his mother's regrets, meanwhile, Sten Sanjorge had started prospecting in the early 1960s.
By the early 1970s, a new gas company, GAStech, began its juggernaut-like advances.
Under his canny guidance, GAStech evolved into a major supplier of natural gas to the local region, and then much further afield. It now has thousands employees and operates in numerous countries. 
The change in Centrum has been substantial.  You notice them in the constant clutter of helicopters to-ing and fro-ing out to remote areas, and the planes lined up at the city's airport to shuttle execs back and forth from the city.
And as you drive round Centrum, almost every roundabout is sponsored by a division of GAStech. 
Sanjorge has recently started paying more attention to leisure activities and philanthropy, allowing his son Sten Jr. and co-founder Hank Fluss to run the company. But Sanjorge has just been asked to produce a report for the Tethan government recommending the best ways of ensuring that Tethys continues to produce energy for decades to come.
The easy-to-get stuff has been produced, so keeping the gas coming will need much investment and more clever new techniques, such as the hyper-acidic substrate removal techniques developed by the company in 1974. 
So thanks to clever people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, Centrum has achieved what every place where raw materials are discovered longs to do. The city has taken the temporary boon of energy on its doorstep, and turned it into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which may make Centrum a centre of gas expertise long after the gas itself runs out.

An alarming new trend is sweeping Abila. Police point out a dramatic increase in drug related arrests that may be linked to violent activist groups. 
The port of Abila is known to be a transshipment point for drugs coming from the Middle East and Africa going to Europe namely heroin and hashish. However, drug related arrests had remained flat over the past decade until the recent increase. 
The concerns over the increase of drug related arrests are two-fold: first, violent activist groups such as the Protectors of Kronos could be using drug sales as a means to fund their activities; and second, with more drugs appearing on the shore, the people of Kronos will suffer increased drug related issues, namely addiction and violence.

This article is the first installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos.
ELODIS, Kronos - Nestled in the bend of the Tiskele River, the sun rises over the farming town of Elodis,  chasing away the shadows cloaking nearby Mt. Bouro.  Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos.
Two weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around Tiskele Bend. In his email he described a once bountiful region now distressed by contamination, struggling to find solutions to a worsening problem.  I decided to investigate.
""We didn't make the connection at first,"" Reese told me when I met with him at his office.  ""The gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away.   After a couple of harvests, we saw a decline in the production.   We thought perhaps it was just a hiccup, and things would get better.  Then when the kids started getting sick we took a harder look at what could have changed.""
The change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out of Tethys.
Established in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.

A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a café where you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations.
""We've made a good living for a long time,"" Reese tells me. ""The population has been steadily increasing.  Crop production has been good.  For the most part, kids haven't left for the city as they have in a lot of other rural places.  We have a lot of land that could yet be developed. There was a future for them here.""
I asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech's operations.  He introduced me to a farmer whose family had been here for several generations.  
I caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at the Osvaldo hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm.

This article is the second installment of a three-part series addressing the growing problem of one community's anguish, government malfeasance, and the alarming influence of multinational corporations on the country of Kronos.
I caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at Ferro Hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm.
""We've worked the land for a long time - maybe 200 years, maybe a bit more,"" Henk Bodrogi told me as he picked over a container of bolts, searching for the right size.  ""Over the years we've added a few hectares here and there.  It keeps us busy.""
Busy is an understatement, as I found when I prodded the wiry farmer to tell me more.
""I usually head to the fields before sun up,"" Mr. Henk Bodrogi tells me. ""My wife gets the kids up and heading to school, then she'll make a little something for us to eat for lunch and work alongside me until dinner.  When the children get home from school they do their chores, and we're all back at the house most times by dark.""
""We do this most days,"" he adds, ""except for worship days.""
Bodrogi identifies the appropriate bolt and chats with the cashier about kids and school as he completes his purchase.
""We all know one another here,"" Bodrogi explains as we leave. ""Most families have lived here for generations.  The first new people that came to town were with that gas company that built a few years back.""
I ask Bodrogi if business has been good. 
""We were doing pretty good until recently.  Profits were good and we add acreage, or upgrade equipment.  Then we started having all this trouble with the crops.""
In what way, I asked.
""The crops aren't producing like they have in the past.  It took a while to figure out, then one of the city officers figured out to call in a water specialist.  When they tested it they said the water was contaminated.""
Bodrodgi sighed, and with a beleaguered look in his eye he thanked me for my interest and told me he had to head back home.  The tractor had to be fixed before they could work the next day.  I thanked him and watched him climb into his truck and head out of town.
The water specialist turned out to be the international agency ""Wellness For All"", an international agency with a mission to bring healthy water to communities distressed by natural disasters, draught and - coincidentally - oil and gas development.
I caught up with a representative from Wellness for All the next day.  Joclyn Reynolds is project coordinator for ""Wellness for All"".  She spoke to me over a satellite call from her field office in Southeast Asia where she was setting up relief efforts following an earthquake. Ms. Reynolds agreed to speak to me for a few minutes between meetings about their work in Elodis.
""We were contacted by a city official about a problem they were having with their local water.  In the last few years agriculture had foundered, and the incidence of certain illnesses and birth defects had risen.  The Elodis drinking water comes from the Tiskele River, as does all the water for farming, so we looked for a source upstream.  We found sources of production waste disposal at the GAStech operation upstream.  Tests showed high levels of benzene, toluene, xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, among other toxins. ""
""Can these substances occur naturally?"" I asked her.
""Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly.  Groundwater contamination is usually the result of human activity.  The GAStech pipes are releasing contaminants into a pond.  The toxins are forming a subsurface plume that seeps into the Tiskele River from which the residents of Elodis draw their drinking water and irrigation for the crops.""
""Did you talk to GAStech about this?""
""Oh yes,"" she replied.  ""At first we believed we were gaining traction.  We met several times with GAStech representatives, including one of the senior executives, Hank Fluss.  He personally assured us GAStech would act responsibly to provide material and financial assistance toward cleanup efforts.  After a time, though, it became clear that while Mr. Fluss was earnest it was Sanjorge who makes the decisions.  It is apparent that he [Sanjorge] has no interest in the wellbeing of the residents of Elodis, or the environment.""
Sten Sanjorge, Jr., who had inherited his share in the company from his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for cutthroat business practices.
""When we didn't make headway with GAStech,"" Reynolds continued, ""the community leaders decided to approach the government of Kronos for assistance.   Per our policy -and with permission from the Elodis leaders - we published the test results in an official public document.  The Elodis leaders then approached the government officials as citizens of a Kronesian community armed with the scientific analysis.  Our agency assured them we would again be available to help in any way when those agreements were finalized.""
At this point Ms Reynolds was called away from the phone, so I returned to my editor friend, Pondo Reese to tell finish the story.

The GAStech-owned well near Elodis ignited methane gas underground causing a fire that lasted for around an hour. At least four GAStech employees appeared to have been taken away by ambulance; however, GAStech has declined to comment on the extent and nature of their injuries. 
GAStech's CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. downplayed the event stating, ""This event could hardly be described as an explosion,"" but merely a common practice referred to as flaring. He continued, ""I won't bore you with the details, but a temporary flare is often used during well production testing."" 
Mrs. Cato and other locals from Elodis were turned away by GAStech employees and government officials. Eventually, locals downriver were evacuated. Rebecca Cato said, ""After sending us away without a single question answered, they came to our doors and told us to leave our homes. It was the middle of the night where was I to go.""

The chief of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, whose photograph fixedly looks at outside calendars and executives of table everywhere in the country, recognizes ""state the charges in state"", but wire-drawer owing to the fact that the needs for company simply to deal of his workmen and the communities around them.
Naturally, to populate the good reasons of the need to come and work in the areas remotely hostile of Kronosian. They are equipped with medical care, entertainment, and food. The empire of GAStech has 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its farms of company, court of the rooms of gymnastics, and offers holidays subsidized in resources of the Black Sea for the principal employees. For executives, it runs a current situation, a medical center marble-striped and of therapy.
In addition to all these advantages, there is also the station of GAStech TV, which does not even pretend to be impartial. It is there to serve the will of the company.
This seems hardly the image of a modern total company, like the majority of those without ceremony emptied their ""activities of not-core"". There is an argument, however, that the businesses of energy are different from other industries, requiring companies of energy to function in the distinct ways.
By working in the distant places without average precedents infrastructure to oil and the gas sites will be always, to a certain extent, of the towns of company. GAStech tries certainly to ensure its employees can move in and out of these places by actuating a private fleet of four planes to transport out of vat its personnel the enormous distances between the sites.

Reported missing includes: GAStech President and CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr,CFO Ingrid Barranco, CIO Ada Campo-Corrente, COO Orhan Strum, and Environmental Officer Willem Vasco-Pais.
Local news organizations have received a ransom note from the POK claiming responsibility and demanding $20 Million from the company.  It is possible additional demands are forthcoming.
Sanjorge and the others disappeared following a board meeting at GASTech headquarters.  A fire alarm went off, and the execs were discovered missing shortly after that.  The complete list of all the unaccounted-for employees has not been released. 
John Rathburn, an American expert on executive kidnappings who is living in Tethys, says that Kronos has not been known as an archetypal country for kidnapping. ""However, increased activity by POK, APA [Asterian People's Army], and others in the region have significantly increased the risk.""

It is the biggest company in Kronos, the third largest gas company on the planet, and it is fifty-three years old. In the past it has had a reputation as corrupt and environmentally harmful, but nowadays GAStech, the former Tethys-only business, is trying to earn the trust of international investors. 
It is an uphill task, and there is no certainty that Gastech has the ability to convince potential investors it has mended its ways, and is no longer rooted in the eco-hostile past. 
GAStech's pipeline operations are based in eastern Kronos, and there is close relationship with the Kronosian government. This is the heart of Kronos's pipeline business, where gas from the eastern gas fields is piped west towards the rest of Kronos, Tethys and Europe. 
GAStech does more than just pump gas.

There is an argument, however, that the energy business is different from other industries, requiring energy corporations to operate in distinct ways. 
Working in far-off places with no previous infrastructure means oil and gas sites will always be, to some extent, company towns.

Recent charges of groundwater contamination against GAStech International and tightening environmental regulations lead by the Tethan Interior Minister, Ivar Blanes, certainly play into the shifting focus.

President Araullo hailed the landmark deal as ""the beginning of a new era for our great country, an era of opportunity and fortune for all.""  Our sources at the Ministry of Interior tell us that the 50% tax levied on new oil and gas exploration could yield in excess of $1 billion in tax revenue per year.

The government of Kronos has declared the Protectors of Kronos a terrorist group after blaming it for a deadly attack on police headquarters earlier this week.
Several of its supporters have been arrested in a crackdown.
A POK leader vowed that protests would continue.
Government spokesman Rufus Drymiau announced the move, which will give the authorities more power to crack down on the POK.
He said that those who belonged to the group, financed it or promoted its activities would face punishment.

The Protectors of Kronos
Kronos's oldest and largest environmental activist organization
Founded in 1997.
Influenced by international groups such as Wellness for All
Mixes political activism with environmental work
Rejects use of violence and supports democratic principles
Slogan: ""Justice for Juliana"", a reference to a 10-year old Kronosian girl who died as a result of government sponsored environmental contamination 
The decision was in response to Tuesday's bombing of a police headquarters in Abila, he said.
""Kronos was horrified from north to south by the hideous crime committed by the POK,"" Mr. Drymiau said.
""This was in context of dangerous escalation to violence against Kronos and Kronosians and a clear declaration by the POK that it knows nothing but violence.
""It's not possible for Kronos the state nor Kronos the people to submit to the POK terrorism.""
Kronos would notify Tethys who had signed a 1998 anti-terrorism treaty of the decision, he added.

The Protectors of Kronos 
Kronos's oldest and largest environmental activist organization 
Founded in 1997. 
Influenced by international groups such as Wellness for All 
Mixes political activism with environmental work 
Rejects use of violence and supports democratic principles 
Slogan: ""Justice for Juliana"", a reference to a 10-year old Kronosian girl who died as a result of government sponsored environmental contamination  
The decision was in response to Tuesday's bombing of a police headquarters in Abila, he said. 
""Kronos was horrified from north to south by the hideous crime committed by the POK,"" Mr. Drymiau said. 
""This was in context of dangerous escalation to violence against Kronos and Kronosians and a clear declaration by the POK that it knows nothing but violence. 
""It's not possible for Kronos the state nor Kronos the people to submit to the POK terrorism.""

Today is the fifth anniversary of President Araullo's visionary plan to bring foreign investment to Kronos, a bold act that has reaped tremendous benefits for our fair country.  Today's Abila is a bustling metropolis full of new cars, new construction, gleaming office buildings, and modern conveniences.  Gone are the potholed streets, run-down factories, tired storefronts, and sad marketplaces of the past.  Today's Abila is a city of industry, a place of commerce and investment, a place of opportunity and success.  Prosperity has come to Kronos, and we are all the better for it.
However, there are still those who wrongly think that prosperity is bad for us.  These people claim that foreign investment is bad for our country, that it is diluting our culture and undermining our values.  They claim that the foreigners are exploiting us for their own gain and that our government has little regard for the welfare of our people.  They are so militant in their wrong-headed beliefs that they have fabricated claims that the foreign companies are poisoning our children with their technology.  They have even gone so far as to have brought in foreign ""experts"" who claim to ""have our best interests at heart"" to help spread their agenda against progress and prosperity for our people.  The hypocrisy of bringing in foreigners to tell us that opening our country to foreigners is bad for us is ludicrous and is obviously a sign of mental illness in those who oppose our modernization.

Demonstrators in Abilia, Kronos have set fire to government buildings, in another round of unrest in this torn city
Dozens of people have been injured in protests over perceived government corruption and perceived inability of politicians to improve the situation.
Police used rubber bullets and tear gas to quell unrest in the capital Abila . Black smoke could be seen coming from the presidency compound in Abila.
<< Continue reading the main story >>	
A Protectors of Kronos spokesperson stated ""In Kronos the legacies of the environmental neglect and lack of concern for the people mean that few even hope for change anymore. For this reason, anger has been simmering for years, but now it has boiled over""
Police used water to disperse the protesters who were throwing stones at the building. There were also reports of an attempted storming of the office.
""People protest because they are suffering, because they don't have medical help. We demand the government resign,"" Terek Kamal, a truck driver, told the Times.
The unrest began in Abila earlier in the week, with protests over the dismissal of several Kronosian employees from energy giant GAStech International.  GAStech has its roots in Tethys, although many directors live in Kronos.
This appears to be a case of simmering frustration boiling over.
The administration is highly supportive of GAStech and its tax income to the government coffers - yet seems to ignore any pressing issues but its own above-average pay packets.
The environmental  situation is desperate. Hundreds of rural citizens are suffering major illnesses apparently caused by exposure to GAStech waste streams, although this has not been official substantiated or acknowledge by either the company or government. 
That is what sparked the initial protests in Abila - but empathy with their cause brought demonstrators out in towns across Kronos.  Initially peaceful, these protest are now increasingly violent, and both police and citizens are caught in sometime fatal crossfire.  
Kronos President  Dorel Kapelou II is quoted as saying he would be calling an urgent meeting of the top leadership to address the ""terrorist threat to peace"" in the country.

Interpol has announced the formation of a new multi-country task force to combat the increasingly wide distribution of the drug methyldimethyl cathinone (MDMC). 
This particular blend of the drug MDMC, also known by its street names ""cotton candy"", ""spice dreams"" and ""Tulip Blossom"", was found previously only in Asteria but has made its way to the streets of Tethys and other international countries.  ""An increase in mental health problems, including hallucinations and paranoia, accompanied by violent behavior and a marked increase in suicide rates are only a few of the indicators of the usage of this designer drug.""

Interpol has announced the formation of a new multi-country task force to combat the increasingly wide distribution of the drug methyldimethyl cathinone (MDMC).  Heading the task force is Senior Inspector Robert Loblaw, a veteran officer who led the very successful Tethys Counterdrug Team. 
""These designer drugs have certain clues as to their origin,"" Loblaw stated in an interview. 
This particular blend of the drug MDMC, also known by its street names ""cotton candy"", ""spice dreams"" and ""Tulip Blossom"", was found previously only in Asteria but has made its way to the streets of Tethys and other international countries. 
The Asterian People's Army (APA) is a paramilitary organization which has been engaged in terrorist activities funded through its criminal enterprises, which include drug trafficking.  In recent years the APA has sought to build their brand through websites and the publication of a professional, high-quality magazine called ""Arise"". 
Senior Inspector Loblaw says the Tethys public statistics indicate MDMC is a growing problem with the country's youth.  ""An increase in mental health problems, including hallucinations and paranoia, accompanied by violent behavior and a marked increase in suicide rates are only a few of the indicators of the usage of this designer drug.""

Government heavies obstructed the free speech - yet again - of members of the activist group Protectors of Kronos yesterday at a lawful demonstration at the Tiskele Bend fields.  The five POK activists had gathered in front of the gates to GAStech gas drilling operations facility to bring public awareness about the polluted Tiskele River which has caused health problems to the residents of Elodis.
Bystanders report that the demonstration had begun peacefully with the five POK members walking back and forth across the road, chanting ""Remember Juliana!"" and ""No more poison!""  
An eyewitness told the Homeland Illumination that when the gates opened to allow GAStech company vehicles to exit the facility the protesters moved aside.  Witnesses agree that at the same time vehicles with the Government of Kronos seal drove to the gates, apparently planning to enter the facility. 
""It was all very civil up till then,"" Griffith Mabel, an Elodis resident who had come out to support the POK told the Homeland Illumination.   ""The gates opened, the POK people moved and the trucks drove out.  That's when it got weird.  The trucks stopped in the middle of the road for no reason.""
Another eyewitness, Elodis farmer Charley Normand adds, ""Yeah, the POK guys asked the drivers to move nicely, but the GAStech drivers ignored them.  They had their windows down, so it wasn't like they couldn't hear them.""
The occupants of the government vehicles exited and joined the altercation.  The sequence of events becomes confusing at this point.  Some witnesses state the GAStech drivers instigated arguments with the protestors, and others think the government officials began to strong arm the protesters from the road.
""Turns out the people in the government cars were police,"" Mabel tells the Homeland Illumination.  ""They wore uniforms and had badges.""
Onlookers tell the Homeland Illumination that the three parties began yelling, and at some point the Kronos police - presumably from Abila-  arrested the five activists and transported them to an Elodis jail.
Despite repeated requests for an interview, the Homeland Illumination has not been granted access to those arrested.

Thousands of protesters carrying banners reading ""Remember Juliana!"" and chanting ""We want truth!"" rallied in front of the Kronos government offices Saturday morning. Protesters were demanding an accounting of the government revenues from then President Araullo's tax incentives that were signed into law in 1993.
Ten-year old Juliana Vann died in 1998 from an illness caused by contaminated water from GAStech drilling operations. She has become the heart-rending icon of a movement that has gained support from one end of Kronos to the other.
""We were promised better jobs, new roads, better healthcare and a better standard of living,"" said one 20-year old protestor who declined to have her name used.  ""All I see are bigger mansions for the ministers and a hospital that costs more to fix than it can make.  We won't accept that!""
The protestor was referring to Abila General Hospital built in 1997 ostensibly with money from the increased revenue from the foreign gas operations here on Kronos.  The non-profit hospital has had difficulty maintaining its infrastructure, despite the extensive restoration performed sevearl years ago to replace the electrical and plumbing systems.
""The contracts were all given to family and cronies of the ministers,"" accuses 26-year old Jon L., who traveled six hours to attend yesterday's rally.  ""What we need is transparency in our government.  We need to know what happens to all the money coming in from these foreign companies.
Protest leader Elian Karel addressed the demonstrators at Abila City park.  Karel took over POK leadership from Henk Bodrogi, whose ill health forced him down from the position.  Karel spoke eloquently about the beginnings of the POK campaign as a grassroots effort for clean water, to the dynamic movement it has become demanding improved government transparency and accountability.
""We aren't asking for anything unreasonable,"" Karel speaks passionately to his ardent listeners.  ""All we want is to know how our taxes are being used.  We know these corporations are generating records profits at the expense of Kronos, but we see none of the promised improvements.  All we want is accountability for those who died because of greed, corruption and disregard of those who they should be protecting.""
Calls to the President's office were not immediately returned.

A rally of hundreds of protestors allied with the ""Protectors of Kronos"" movement turned to violence today as angry activists vented their displeasure on the innocent citizens of Abila after hearing the news of POK leader Elian Karel's death.  Karel, who had been awaiting trial for tax evasion, was found dead in his jail cell yesterday morning.  
The POK assembly began peacefully enough with the usual chanted slogans and waving of protest signs, but then one young rabble-rouser grabbed a bullhorn and began inciting the crowd to violence.  The crowd smashed windows and vandalized shops in the Siopa area, set fires in the streets, and clashed with police.  Additional police forces responded to contain the chaos and they were forced to use rubber bullets and tear gas in order to disperse the crowds.
President Kapelou's office released a statement about the rally, stating, ""This sort of violence will not be condoned.  Destruction and violence is no way to achieve peace and change - these things are in opposition to each other.  The Protectors of Kronos must resume peaceful means; all other approaches are unjustifiable.""

The son of the founder of gas firm GAStech is planning a venture to drill in the Mediterranean Sea, the Times has learned.
Sten Sanjorge, Jr. believes there are large volumes of offshore gas that could be extracted.
Sanjorge and GAStech were awarded three licences by the Kronos government last month by the Ministry for Energy and Development and hopes to begin exploration soon.
""Certainly offshore gas isn't a new concept, but there's no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can't develop these resources offshore,"" he told the Times.
Shale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within.
Hyper-acidic substrate removal has produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the West, transforming the energy market. But projects in Europe have been slow to take off, beset with opposition from government and local communities.
Sanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited.
Many environmentalists believe that hyper-acidic substrate removal can damage marine environments, and oppose the extraction of new fossil fuel resources. But drilling offshore avoids the need for difficult negotiations with local councils, communities and landholders.
Based on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech's estimates for its onshore resources. There is also the possibility of finding oil.
GAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore.
""We're very comfortable that the resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous,"" SanJorge said. ""Is any of that exploitable? That's the billion dollar question, and GAStech is wiling to invest in the answer.""
Though it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done.
Professor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term.
""GAStech is being optimistic is its estimates of how long it will take to explore offshore shale. It's perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyper-acidic substrate removal technology will have so advanced and the way in which we deal with the offshore environment will have so advanced that this could be a really big industry. The task in the next 10 years is to try these things out, see if they work.""

Earlier this year a series Homeland Illumination published a series of articles about groundwater contamination in Elodis, and how the locals are demanding a government response for what is essentially Government of Kronos-sponsored pollution and poisoning of citizens.  This article is an update.
ELODIS, Kronos - Ten-year old Juliana Vann died yesterday afternoon, surrounded by her family and friends.  The cause of death was leukemia due to benzene poisoning.
Juliana had been sick for over a year.  Initially her family didn't realize that benzene poisoning was the cause of Juliana's problems.  After visits to many hospitals, a doctor associated with the international assistance organization Wellness For All recommended Juliana be tests for benzene poisoning.  At that point, however, the little girl's system was too damaged to recover.
The residents of Elodis have been pleading with the government of Kronos to take action against the pollution caused by the GAStech gas drilling operation just 20 km upstream from Elodis.
Juliana's death is but one of several deaths this rural township has suffered because of toxic waste being dumped into the Tiskele River by Tethys corporation GAStech.
Private funeral services will be held on August 21 in the family home.

ABILA, Kronos - With the third anniversary of Elian Karel's death approaching - former member of the Protectors of Kronos - the question is: who are the protesters?  
The Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis on the advice of the now defunct Wellness for All (WFA), an international water safety group. The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts that GAStech International's Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis. However, with the fragmenting of WFA due to funding issues, the POK's demands were largely ignored and downplayed. The Government of Kronos officially refuted the claim citing the fragmentation of the WFA organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted. Regardless, Juliana became the POK's first martyr and has used Juliana's image on campaign literature ever since.  
The POK's second major martyr is Elian Karel, who died in 2009 while incarcerated of undetermined causes. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion. Karel had been involved with the POK since its inception given that his father, Jeroen Karel, was an original member.  
The POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people. As of 2011, the Government of Kronos has labeled the POK as a ""public threat"".
